that 's what i always say .
this is a police control <unk>
yeah ... then i <unk> ... like this .
yes . what we 're looking for is rather specific .

i am ! i am ! i 'm stopping it - slowly . you see ! look , i 've stopped . now we are going back .

but anna wouldn 't be staying with the kind of people who live here .
anything you say , <unk> .

i --
got a love affair with police work . drives me crazy with it .
isn 't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop ? a good cop can 't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle 's missing . a bad cop can 't sleep 'cause his conscience won 't let him . you said that once , remember ?
yes you are , my dearest . you are mine and louis ' daughter . you see louis was going to leave us . he was going to go away . but now he 's not . he 's going to stay and make you happy .
and do what with it ?

nice tattoo , dietz .
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself . however , since i can 't have you following me either --

beats me . you got a suggestion , feel free to shout it out , genius .
the delivery boy .
that was the idea .
because if there 's more than one party involved , if we really are working for different people , then perhaps some of us are on different sides . your orders might be different from mine .
i know , i know . <unk> 's dead , but we can deal with it . we 'll pin it on him . the <unk> was driving jesse 's car . no car phone . no radio . they couldn 't have called me in .
despite what you think , i don 't do it on purpose . and i have no intention of doing it again .
i 'm sorry . the fire 's gone out .
look , maybe you oughta ' leave .
where you guys been ? we had to start without you .

what the hell is going on here ?
i 'm glad you 're doing so well . if they haven 't made you squad leader by now , i 'm sure you will .

i can write it . i can 't type it .
oh , yeh .
whaddya mean you don 't know ? you either got a lot or you don 't . what 's not to know ?
let 's just say i 'm a friend . and watch yourself from now on with those things , okay ? i mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings .
where 'd you learn all this stuff ?
yes . and i don 't want to know where you got it .
<unk> , basically . bit more stable . i learned howto make it when i was a kid .
i 'm just sayin ' -- it was a steep hillside . there was no moon that night ...

it seems , 007 , we 've received a tip
so ... nice ship you got here . what 's our next move ?
i 'm sorry , <unk> ... he 's ... he didn 't make it .
nope .
'cause i love you .
i don 't know . who was that guy that used to talk about <unk> in new york ?
i 've got a ton of work and no good people .
this is a cinch . i look up , i look down . i look up --
no easy boyd ! i got a best friend in there in pieces . how about a little sensitivity ?
we 're not <unk> .
no , it 's true . last night when you were sleeping , i had you all to myself .

the special hats of the special <unk> detachment of the border patrol .
nope .
<unk> , i think . <unk> department . figures . they 're all <unk> .

when she said it , there was something familiar ... but no .

no worries
hey , man , at least in study hail i could meditate .
okay . i want you to hear this too . we 've got to be cool . all of us . people think i 'm rich , for christ 's sake . i 'm doing what rich guys do . i 'm spending my money . it 's more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing . now don 't let this cop fuck with your minds .

maybe some <unk> 'll chase those blues away .
a lot of people . teachers . younger kids . it 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason . but that 's ok ... because i know i deserve it .
i was sitting there .

the back door was open .
he never would have made it past the rats ! he hates rats ! he 's scared to death of them !
you have no taste .
good .
i don 't want to eat ! and there 's one more thing i don 't want ! definitely ! that 's to see you .
seems to me i 've already thanked you for that . what time is the next bus to new york ?
al , you can 't tell a mink from a <unk> unless you see the fur up close . goddamn , sam ! if we don 't start reading between the lines here ! <unk> got ta start thinking on a different level - like the <unk> does . we 're through the looking glass . here white is black and black is white .
no , you 're awake , bill , and i 'm dead serious . and we 're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago . how did you find out dave <unk> drove to texas that day ?

this is the kinda mistake can take a hindu 's lifetime to <unk> ... you better get a move on , johnnie , before that boy got her holdin ' down a memphis <unk> and shootin ' dope up her arms .

shut up , <unk> . bud , how you doing ?

oh good ! we haven 't seen an anastasia in several days !

i 'm staying .
it 's a long shot .
what 's that ? a democrat with an attitude !
i don 't care . i 'm not staying out late doug .
no i 'm not , i came to prague looking for something - this could be it !
working ... <unk> cover .
no , no , not beyond an acceptable level . have you been <unk> recently , martin ?
<unk> !

there 's a man . i woke up next to a man ...
what 's your problem <unk> ?
cool , huh huh . hey <unk> that 's that dude that 's paying us to do his wife .
uh , my butt and your ... uh , butt .
we 're ghosts .

dude ! dude , i 'm sorry !
where 's the money , <unk> ?
-- the marks appear , then you disappear . like the little <unk> boy , like domini , as soon as they come to full bloom -- and mine < u > are < <unk> > !
yeah .
i don 't remember !
how do i know you are cops ?
you don 't exist any more . i 've killed you . jill layton is dead .

okay .
ask them .
cunt .
i 'm through listening to you !
no . for a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough .
no . hell , it 's the <unk> goddamn party i 've ever seen .
without a love of my own .
yes . from <unk> . to celebrate , the license approval for our <unk> firm . i forgot to tell you .
my last lesson 's next week . james ... my car ...

you saved me , <unk> . as different and <unk> as it 's been sometimes , your goddamn strict <unk> and science have saved me a thousand times ; have kept me honest and made me whole . i owe you so much , <unk> , and you owe me nothing . i don 't want to do this without you . i don 't know if i can . if i quit now , they win .
i 'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident . the only important thing is that he 's dead .
<unk> , stop <unk> , will you ?
well that 's good news for us . it means the system is <unk> . this should be easy . <unk> .

a car is not just a car where i come from . i had this friend , had this wicked candy apple red <unk> and a half <unk> --
the heart of the ocean . cal , it 's ... it 's overwhelming .
i 'm afraid i 'm feeling a little tired , mr. <unk> .
we 'll be expecting you .
yeah -- if he 'd only stick to <unk> .

well , yes sir . a professor morton , but with just a little more time , sir , i can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...
somebody has to do it .
