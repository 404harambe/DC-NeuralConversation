the scope is lit , it 's right in front of us ...
range 500 meters and holding . turbulence is dropping off ...
maybe a power interruption crashed the system ...
in our current environment , dr. weir , self-control is an asset .
i don 't think she 's real big on hate .

the boys are back in town ! ! !
mordant , go with them and report back to me !

my harrier . join us , colonel .
colonel tarleton , you deal with these damned rebels .
civility is a secondary virtue . it is superseded by duty .
do you see that , colonel ?
father , a post rider came from charleston . you have a letter inside .
do you intend to enlist without my permission ?
did your father teach you humility ?
and , corporal ... ... be careful .
these four wagons must be his .
his wife was killed yesterday . she was with child .

father , i saw a post rider at the house .
father , you can 't let them take him ...
but where are we going , mr. crandall ?

honey , church will be fine .
i want to fly it ! can i fly it now , mommy !

i want to look around , daddy -- may i ?

that 's proper , sir , according to the code .
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request . means 'no . '
you have a name , missy ?
the curse drove you to gather this ?

it 's -- beautiful . may i inquire as to the occasion ?
elizabeth , this is hardly appropriate --
i 'm glad we got here in time .
i can 't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us .
has it changed since the last time you were here ?
captain sparrow ! we have to get off this island -- immediately !
kid 's a bit of a stick , isn 't he ?
we 'd best drop canvas , sir !

how did you get off the island ?
blast it , i 'm already awake !
we can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few --
all the men in place , sir . ready to fire .
sir ! shall i break out the cannons ?
this dock is off-limits to civilians .
well , well ... jack sparrow , isn 't it ?
but it seems to be enough to condemn him .
we had time to get to know each other .
this is either crazy , or brilliant .
everybody stay calm . we 're taking over the ship !
shut up , before you lose them all !
wait -- what about the pistol ?
miss swann ! we 're here to rescue you ! it 's going badly !
will -- don 't do anything stupid ! don 't say anything stupid --
are you certain this is the right way ?
what 's your business in port royal , 'mr . smith ' ?
how long do you leave him in there ?
what are you going to do to him ?
i should kill you right now for what you did to me !
as you can see i am a new man , just like you .
a containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention .
poppy , are you in one of your moods again ?
she could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys .
they 're here ! they 're here ! we have the nanobot .

i think i better go , stew .
i 'm sure you 're quite willing to be decent about this .
you 're not going to print this silly thing , are you ?
where did you get those letters ?
i suppose you 're going to print them ?
oh , i don 't need another guess . it 's quite obvious .
will you step into the library ?

no ? what do you look upon her as ?
is this true , stewart ? did you really say it ?

do you have another tie ? something more conservative ?
i 'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary .

you can touch me , i won 't bite .
hi . just checking to see if you 're here .
it was nice having you `` watch over me '' ...
i 'll have to pack a lot of clothes .
i 'll miss you , mike .
... just saying you should think twice about it ...
we 're not going to the game , are we mom ?
mom , what 's going to happen with you and dad ?
hey , can we go to mcdonald 's ?
think i should put the skateboard in bed with him ?
i read the article . you didn 't tell me she was so beautiful .
i 'm sorry . i know i heard noises ... the detective 's wife ...
my wife talks to his wife about what shift i 'm gon na take ?
was it venza ? did you get him ?
why not patrol ? they 'd do just as good a job .
what about when she goes out ?
they 're operating on him . he 's still alive .
i heard a lot ... anything you want to deny , mike ?
tell me i 'm dreamin ' .
you 're here 'til what time ?
god ! scrambled eggs surprise ? ! these are pickles ... ! god !
what ! what kind of pathetic line is that ?
time to get my bowling ball re drilled .
well , look who 's dressing for success .
peter -- you took this picture ?
mistake ? hey , guy , get back here !
you maniac . you 'll blow your scholarship .
great idea . let me get some shoes . i 'll take you home .
too hip . your photos suck , kid .
all right , amazing . are you quite finished ?
no . i was lying about the coffee .
brrr . it 's colder than new hampshire in here .
hello . earth to peter . are you listening ?
i 'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon .
hold it . can we stop being clever , just for a moment ?
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship , you know .
roz ? rosomoff ? what is it ?
there 's nothing in there worth stealing !
aunt may , you 're trespassing .
when i moved out , you swore up and down you wouldn 't meddle --
oh , not that . you promised you 'd burn it .
then the alumni reports came in -- fund-raising is down this year .
that nobel prize will just have to wait .
so they 're airing this tonight ?
mr. reiss -- i need a quarter --
spider-man , be careful ! he 's quite mad .
professor , you ever fly one of these things before ?
maybe just a hint or so . think hard .
they ought to be under the barbed wire soon .
w-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m -- ?
there 's only one pair left .
now what kind of a crack is that ?
what are you looking at him for ? any objections , sefton ?
next we 're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable .
brother , were we all wet about you !
put me down for ten , you louse .
don 't ask me . price was elected security .
how did he get over there ?
then we 're all in on it ?
lieutenant dunbar ? it wouldn 't be james schuyler dunbar ? from boston ?
when you get going on those broads , think of me !
i 'll kill you , harry -- so help me !
let me go ! let me go !
don 't you remember , animal ? a chicken lays those things .
wunderbar ! isn 't he wunderbar !
equipoise ! equipoise ! what did i tell you , animal ?
that schulz pig . i 'll get him yet .
why don 't we just look in those footlockers ?
there , joey -- ain 't that better than being a lawyer ?
may i have this dance , miss ?
look -- if you don 't like the way i 'm handling this job --
don 't worry . we 'll take care of it .
cut the horseplay , harry . what 's the matter with you guys ?
what are you going to do ?
no volunteers , price . i said we 're all in on it .
you must get out . for your own good , you must get out .
stay out of it , sefton .
if you can 't get the bbc , how about getting guy lombardo ?
what 's it add up to you , sefton ?
what are we going to do with him ?
when the krauts find that gadget they 'll throw us all in the boob .
so was the radio private property . so was manfredi and johnson .
say , schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night ?
which one of us is the informer ?
i 'll make it five hundred !
what 's the matter with you ? you want to be killed ?
just get us a couple with big glockenspiels .
is it all right if we smell it ?
that wouldn 't be the cigarettes you took us for last night ?
you must have been some tail gunner ! go ahead , cookie .
have a nice time over there ?
so you 're stuck with me , eh ?
you 're not disposing of those russian broads ?
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage .
actually , captain , your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way .
i get it . i get it .
i don 't see a control panel , or an access port .
data , this isn 't the time .
that 's it , bridge- we 're all out !
sensors show five life signs aboard the station , captain .
could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak ?
we 're within visual range of the energy distortion , captain .
we 're within range , sir .
you did it , kirk ! damage report , ensign .
guinan , what 's going on ? where am i ?
these are my children ... my children .
i 'm captain john harriman . i 'd like to welcome you all aboard .
well , may we have a look around ?
excuse me , gentlemen , if you 'll take your seats .
what about the gravimetric distortions ? they 'll tear us apart .
beautiful day , isn 't it ?
this clock , i gave this clock to bones .
the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death . scotty ?
keep her together until i get back .
maybe they 're not out there .
that 's a pretty big margin of error .
i always thought i 'd have a crack at this chair one day .
captain , are you all right ?
your family history is very important to you , isn 't it ?
or perhaps they 're on the surface .
it looks like we 're too late .
these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors .
they have found a way to penetrate our shields .
as their cloak begins to engage , their shields will drop .
transwarp at your command , sir !
what 's going on ? when do we get paid off ... ?
excelsior closing to 4,000 meters , sir .
admiral , there is no response from the grissom on any channel .
nothing on my scanner , sir .
sir , the shields ... non- responsive .
do you wish to advise starfleet , sir ?
david , i don 't understand ...
approximately two meters long ... cylindrical in form ...
this planet is aging in surges .
if equipment is functioning properly , indications are -- an animal life form .
captain , this is saavik . come in , please ...
i 'm sure starfleet would approve , sir .
captain , what 's happening ? !
aye , sir , she 's got her second wind now .
mr. scott , all power to the weapons systems --
on course , admiral . estimating spacedock in two point one hours .
... admiral , what 's going to happen to enterprise ?
excelsior , the great experiment , is adrift in space .
klingon bird of prey , sir ! she 's arming torpedoes ... !
if i read this right , sir , we have full power .
we are clear and free to navigate .
the planet vulcan . in hailing distance , sir .
mr. sulu , you 're on manual .
standby automatic approach system ... advise approach control .
will you be able to handle that ... ?
i 'll be in my quarters . execute course to the federation boundary .
my lord , enemy commander wishes a truce to confer .
wouldn 't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship ?
i 'm almost afraid to . what did you bring me , contraband klingon --
don 't mince words , bones ; tell me what you really think .
what about the rest of the inspection , admiral ?
it never rains but when it pours --
they even killed the galley chief .
but what if they went -- nowhere ?
now that 's what i call a meal .
hours instead of days , saavik ; now we have minutes instead of hours --
you okay , jim ? how do you feel ?
you did this -- in a day ? !
i 've tried to warn you . scientists are always pawns of the military --
so are we , it looks like .
i told you ! i told you i saw a --
a criminal , captain -- a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering --
why didn 't you tell me ?
let go -- he can 't -- !
steady on course . all systems normal .
sir -- our shields are dropping !
we 'll lose them if they go in there .
yours ... is ... the superior ...
i 'll need ten minutes , sir , 'til the radiation dissipates .
uhura . can 't you augment ?
saavik , for god 's sake , tell her we 're all right .
no , sir ! you 'll flood the whole compartment ... !
if he hadn 't , we 'd be space by now .
meaning you can 't even beam us back ?
there 's a first time for everything , admiral .
will you accompany me to the bridge ?
is it possible their comm system has failed -- ?
admiral , you can 't give him genesis ...
let 's hope he hasn 't changed the combination . he 's quite intelligent ...
admiral , they 're reducing speed .
... the good of the few ...
lieutenant , are you wearing your hair differently ?
this is damned peculiar . yellow alert .
that 's true , admiral . all the memory cells have been emptied .
are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now , lieutenant ?
but the damage report -- we were immobilized ...
hold your course . look sharp ...
saavik , get us out , best speed !
yes , well , why don 't you show him around and ...
course plotted for regula i , admiral ...
reliant in our section this quadrant , sir , and slowing --
i can 't get power , sir !
mr. sulu , lock phasers on target and await my command ...
approaching regula and space lab regula i .
we 're over our heads . mr. sulu , get us out of here .
we are clear and free to navigate .
very well , mr. saavik , clear all moorings .
all moorings are clear , captain .
take her out , mr. saavik .
you -- sent them away . without even letting me say goodbye ?
he never jokes ... perhaps the professor could use your computer .
no ! no ... what did you have in mind ... ?
now wait just a damn minute .
it doesn 't look all that different .
what did you say she was getting ?
wake up , man , wake up !
he 's coming 'round , jim ...
congratulations , jim . i think you 've saved the earth .
angels and ministers of grace , defend us .
... i don 't think he understands ...
you 're saying ... it is a compliment .
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?
no , sir . and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations .
cloaking device is stable ... all systems normal .
the mains are down , sir ! aux power is not responding .
to hunt a species to extinction is not logical .
are you sure it isn 't time for a colorful metaphor ?
you sure you won 't change your mind ?
no , ma'am . no dipshit .
just a little joke . see you later , old friend .
he 's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat ?
it 's true ... what you said ...
what kind of spaceship is this , anyway ?
if we keep going up , they 'll catch us !
oh my god , we 're too late !
weren 't those a birthday present from dr. mccoy ?
come on , fellah -- speak up !
admiral . full power is restored .
mr. spock , where the hell is the power you promised me ?
can we make breakaway speed ! ?
guidance is functional . onboard computer will interface with federation memory bank ...
estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed .
i have no control , sir !
sir -- i 've got some back pressure on manual --
let 's see what she 's got , mr. sulu .
then , this is what it would sound like underwater ?
admiral , i am receiving whale songs .
i 'll have bearing and distance for you , sir .
admiral , i have a signal closing on the whales . bearing 328 degrees .
estimate range , ship to whales !
unidentified aircraft , 40,000 feet msl , range 30 miles , bearing 010 .
i can 't , sir -- nothing !
mr. scott , how soon can we get underway ?
i 'm ready spock . let 's go find george and gracie ...
scotty : are the whale tanks secure ?
you better get up there , sir . we 're having some power fall-off ...
excelsior ? why in god 's name would you want that bucket of bolts ?
well , saavik . i guess this is goodbye .
professor scott , if you 'll --
we were under the impression they were being held against their will .
there 's a cavern at the base of the next hill ...
mother and son . you arranged this ... ?
i have to go home now .
prepare to transport the 'hostages ' to the ship ...
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills ...
... it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence .
why would the federation or the son'a wish to move the ba'ku ?
captain , i 've activated transport inhibitors around the village ...
it isn 't safe for you to remain in this area .
i 'll order riker to turn around .
you 're not going to launch anything until ...
i do not take orders from you .
order them to surrender , and i promise you won 't be court- martialed .
i wonder ... which one of us will be facing that court-martial ...
the countdown control has been transferred to the collector ... i can 't override ...
they 're following the kelbonite deposits ... using the interference to block our transporters ...
moving them is one thing . killing them all ...
we 're about to lose communications with starfleet , captain .
a photon torpedo . isn 't that the universal greeting when communications are down ?
i don 't think they believe us .
the tear is closing on us ... impact in fifteen seconds ...
i thought subspace weapons were banned by the khitomer accord ...
we 're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range , sir .
they 're powering their forward weapons array .
admiral dougherty wants to know why we haven 't left yet ...
prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours .
you must be planning on doing some hunting .
bridge to captain picard . we are approaching sector four-four-one .
direct hit . he 's resetting his shield harmonics ...
he 's activated a transport inhibitor .
doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned ...
should i distribute phasers to the ba'ku , sir ... ?
you need a haircut , commander .
isolinear tags . their transporters can lock onto them .
oh , my god , are they vegetarians ? that 's not in here ...
why would we be involved with these people ?
i have to go back to the silo . will you be all right ?
how long has he been unconscious ?
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg ... ?
have you ever wondered what it 's like to have flesh ?
the vortex is collapsing , sir .
no . human beings do not have that luxury , and neither should i .
what did you do to the batteries ?
i 'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below .
alphanumeric lock . we need a password to get in ...
picard to enterprise . enterprise , please respond .
where 's you get the alloy for the throttle itself ?
ready to deploy the warp nacelles .
passing one-half light speed . the starboard nacelle 's running a little hot ...
their com system must still be down .
they 're getting awfully close ... what the hell are they doing ?
take care of him . he 's a very special man .
i 'd say you already have .
signal the endeavor to fall back . we 'll cover them .
captain , there are five borg ships closing in on our position .
hull integrity down to thirty percent ...
incoming transmission from starfleet command . admiral hayes .
we 're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex ...
a ship-wide decompression has been initiated !
what the hell is happening , worf ?
they 're connecting the conduits to subspace communications ...
worf ! i 'm going to need at least five minutes !
i have to admit there was a moment there when --
worf to bridge . we 're about to enter the environmental control room .
what the hell happened down there , worf ?
captain , they 're firing at a nuclear missile silo ... in central montana .
are we in any danger of being detected by earth defense systems ?
i believe the operation is over .
bet you wish you 'd stood in bed ...
spock , that was actually funny .
calm yourself , doctor , the operation is almost complete ...
what the hell 's going on ?
what kind of creature is this ? last night you two were spooning -
jim , leave me - i 'm finished ...
damned clever if you ask me ...
perhaps with a few small steps at a time . like this one .
too bad we can 't smell her .
they don 't arrest people for having feelings .
doctor mccoy , what is your current medical status ?
i didn 't have the knowledge of klingon anatomy i needed .
i 've always wanted to meet you , captain .
would you care to go topside ?
as captain i am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command .
captain , you 're not going to show them the bridge ? ?
just the size of my head -
captain , if they fire at us with our shields down --
mr. chekov , take us forward , thrusters only , one half impulse power ...
captain , i 'm getting a message from klingon high command .
thank you , captain kirk . the evening has been most ... edifying .
an accident wasn 't good enough ...
isn 't it about time you became something else ?
how much time 's left of your sentence ?
maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed ...
as you were . lieutenant ... ?
i have personally vouched for you in this matter , captain .
the only way to find out if a man 's trustworthy ...
control tower , reading , sir .
captain , we can 't see her , but she gives off heat ...
but we can 't allow them to be taken back to kronos as prisoners .
suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage ?
we can send a message to starfleet command -
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
twenty-four hours from now we won 't have a clue where the captain is .
- could take weeks , sir .
they 're outside the beaming shield . mr. scott , start your engines .
sulu 's giving us his position and telling us he 's standing by ...
you understand that we have lost all contact with captain kirk ... ?
i don 't think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament .
they might as well arrest me , too ; i felt like lieutenant saavik .
do you know where you are ?
aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels , you 're completely normal .
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west ... that direction , sir .
a bit less florid , data .
what do you imagine this is ?
how long until we reach the fleet ?
captain , we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine .
i 'm going to miss you .
but how can he ? he 'll kill you .
imzadi . this is so good .
i 'll always be with you now . now and forever .
how long until he can fire ?
sir , we 're being hailed .
i 'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system .
to find the head , sir ?
sir , i recommend we raise shields .
sir , we 've had an unauthorized access into the main computer .
sir , we 're being hailed .
captain , the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock .
captain , you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command .
she 's not out for a pleasure cruise .
he wasn 't designed to live a complete , human life span .
serving with you has been an honor .
and you 're not as we imagined you .
i am , commander riker ... may i touch your hair ?
romulan ale -- i 'm surprised . i can 't stand it .
all of this so you could capture me ?
praetor , we 've received the transponder signal .
well , that sounds relaxing too .
believe it or not , i think the cavalry has arrived .
it 's accelerating . you have no more time for games .
how long until we reach the rift ?
what is it ? ! ! focus on your job ! !
how many warbirds will you need ?
benny , god , take it easy ...
don 't you think you should call a backup ?
do you have a good map of death valley ?
what do you think of america ?
no ! ! ! no ! ! !
contain it and get back to me .
the extraterrestrial now looks like this .
i won 't let anyone hurt you .
satisfied ? now get out . out .
i will see it next time .
why are you going here ? what is here ?
'lathrop wells , please . i do not speak english . '
when do i get to lathrop wells ?
why did your ship land on this planet ... on earth ?
the cowboys were right . you can make money fast gambling .
how long will it take you to get home ?
i 'm sure we could find a country and western station .
wait . could i have your autograph ?
i have nothing to do . i 'd like to help you .
aghh ... i 'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow .
tell him i 'm not here .
i 'm telling you they 're probably friendly .
there 's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then ...
we have nothing to talk about , lenny .
i made my choice , lenny .
hey , you going to watch or you going to do ?
i feel like you 're turning me into a vcr .
i don 't think that 's a good idea , lenny .
faith , call me , okay ?
i 'm telling ya , it 's over . we used it all up --
hey , the last day of the world and you spend it in bed .
sounds like tick 's already celebrating .
2-2-0-3 . got it . stay on her .
how did you hook up with faith ?
it 's alright . he means it .
greetings , gents . so let 's hear this week 's sad story .
are we having a bad night ?
i need my case . it 's still in the back .
what 's that ? present from faith ?
jesus , mace . back off .
uh unh . no way ! they 'd crucify me .
don 't crank the gain any more . you 're gon na fry yourself .
lenny , have you lost it completely ?
lenny , give them the tape .
goddamnit ! ! 911 is busy !
are you out of your fucking mind ? !
i can 't believe we had to give them the damn tape .
he 's totally cut off from the outer world .
kinda guy you can count on in a pinch .
mace ... you 're a girl .
that 's the original . there are no copies .
hey , lenny . we made it .
problem is , lenny knows everybody .
does koessler know about the suspect zero theory ?
where 's the nuevo american diner ?
the room key 's in the car . on the seat .
be my guest , agent kulok , scrub suits are in the back .
i 've been looking for you .

hum a tune and i 'll sing to it .
[ fantasy time , girls , give it up , give it up . ]
[ lionheart , what happened ? ]

well , you want to or not ?
... and after that sport and i just started hanging out ...
do you really think i should go to the commune ?
nice talking to you , travis .

thanks for the lift , cecil .
are you saying that he 's ...
tomorrow afternoon ... ... oh my god ...
c'mon , i 'll give you two a lift back to the bijou .
well , no , but these gentlemen would like to get some answers ...
so ... you do intend to fix the place up after all ?
wait 'll you see the inside !
we 've been closed for a while .
why don 't you two get out there and dance ?
luke ... what time is it ?
pete . you think maybe you 've had enough ?
any idea how you got here , son ?
... sorry 'bout that , but you do look familiar to me .
can i ... can i t-t-talk to you ?
will you help me , sandy ?
are you a friend of mitch 's ?
mmm . well , good luck , miss daniels .
oh , hi ! did you find her all right ?
miss daniels ? is that you ?
no , thank you . won 't you call me melanie ?
i still don 't understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds .
we 've got an extra room upstairs and everything .
cathy ! get a blanket and some bandages !
mitch , let 's turn back .
how much for the phone calls ?
what good 'll that do ? smoke 's as bad as birds .
you cut yourself outside , miss ?
we don 't have any fog this time of year , mitch .
how do you do , miss daniels ? acknowledge a what ?
seven o'clock , same as usual .
well ... well , is everyone all right ?
i don 't know . we 'll break up the furni ...
mother ! i 'm trying my best ! i 'm ... trying ... my ...
then you knew mitch in san francisco , is that right ?
that 's a chimney swift , all right .
oh , yeah , yeah . how old is she now ?
he was killed last night . by birds .
there 's an ordinance against burning anything in this town , unless it 's ...
after all , you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds .
do you want some mustard with this ?
i got here as fast as i could . where 's cathy ?
you 'd have been safe in san francisco .
we 'd better light some of those lamps .
mitch , if they hear the car starting ... if they see movement ...

it 's flooding like a son of the bitch .
you see where it 's coming in ?
oh god , lins ... i --
no , bud , no ... not you .
we 'll go in through that large breach .
coffey , we 're a little pressed for time .
just get around so your lights are on the hatch .
what 's the matter with you ?
lins , stay away from that guy . i mean it .
hey , you guys are milking that job .
hafta ... go on to ... the moonpool . only way .
you better not say you missed that .
we should be dead . we didn 't decompress .
those guys ain 't so tough . i fought plenty of guys tougher'n them .
are we talkin ' little space friend here ?
that thing was probably their version of big geek ... like an rov .
lady , we better fish or cut bait .
cab one , do you see it yet ?
deepcore , deepcore ... this is cab three on final approach .
figured that out for yourself , did you ?
schoenick ... your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move ...
12000 feet . jesus , i don 't believe he 's doing this .
4800 feet . it 's official .
he 's losing it . talk to him . keep him with us .
but your friend is waiting downstairs .
anna ... maybe it would be better to wait a while .
you know , i could just as well go without seeing him today .
it 's already two hours ... what are we going to do ?
i have a feeling that you 're not used to being alone .
there 's nothing much to laugh at .
shall we go for a swim ?
i think that you might go and have a look yourself .
and you leave me here all alone ... in this hotel room ...
but you know it already . why must i tell you ?
then i 'll see you later .
sandro ... what 's the matter ?
what amazes me , is sandro . he seems so calm .
but where did you finally end up ?
shouldn 't we try to find a quieter place ?
they 're all nudes , if i 'm not mistaken .
now what do i have to do to be left in peace ?
it 's as smooth and slick as oil .
at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes .
looks like the weather is changing .
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat ?
and what are we going to do now ?
first let the poor thing have something to eat .
and here 's sandro . why don 't you two go upstairs and change ?
raimondo ... do you enjoy fishing underwater ?
here i am , patrizia . i 'm always here .
what happens if the bell rings and you 're under there ?
here you are . don 't let anyone know where you got them .
would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long .
all right , what do you need .
stop this , she 'll hurt herself i 'm not going to allow this .
oh , don 't do this !
we 're nearly there , sir .
eh , ringo , do you know what happened to me ?
aye and we 'll have to watch it and all .
oh , listen to teacher 's pet .
oh , paul , you can 't have your own way ! ! !
come on , auntie , you 're winning .
that must have cost you a fortune in stamps , ringo .
i don 't think that bit 's right .
it 's happened at last , we 've become a limited company .
hello , he 's not talking to me . he 's having a sulk .
would you two like a cup of tea ?
and we 're looking after him , are we ?
come on let 's get this coffee .
that 's right ; convict without trial ... habeas corpus .
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him .
and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars !
and another thing , where 's that old mixer ?
aye , he looks a right lurker .
well , what are we waiting for ?
eh , he 's a nice old man , isn 't he ?
let 's go and muck in .
she 's going to show me her stamp collection .
are you listening to me , lennon ?
if you 're going to have a barney i 'll hold your coats .
paul , john , george - get at it .
oh , it 's got round that you 're a heavy punter .
don 't cane me , sir , i was led astray .
leave him alone , he 's got swine fever .
they 're nearly ready for you . they 're just finishing the band call .
control yourself or you 'll spurt . he 's bound to be somewhere .
you 're a window rattler , son .
it 'll only get you into trouble .
that 's right . it 's always me , isn 't it ?
oh dear , i feel like doing a bit of work .
what do you think are you 're up to ?
i 'm sorry norm , but i can 't help being taller than you .
oh they 've probably gone to the canteen , cup of tea , like .
oh , he 's gone to my club , has he ?
what 's the matter with you ? you were bashing away like a madman .
eh . i thought you were looking after the old man .
eh , what 's all this ?
good ! maybe we 'll be able to see something then .
there could be a whole city out there and we 'd never see it .
i don 't recognize that constellation .
can you get it a little closer ?
i 'm sending . do you hear me ?
computer , what language was that ?
unknown ! what do you mean ?
just a minute , hold it , i 'm checking .
oh , no . oh , no .
and then we run out of food and oxygen .
it 's really on there tight .
this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again !
might even incinerate the damn thing .
so it 's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out .
god , that smoke 's poisonous !
it makes me sick to see him like that .
it 's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive .
we can 't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose .
hey now , what is this ?
there . should be coming through about there .
i 'll do it . the rest of you continue .
now we 're in for it .
well ... now we have to herd that thing up here .
it must have stopped moving . i 'm not getting anything .
i keep my mouth pretty much shut , but i don 't like hitting .
i think that 's how it 's getting oxygen to him .
that must have been when he got it .
you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him ?
... and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle .
isn 't `` bait '' the word you used ?
sandy , you want to give us some vision ?
just settle down . sandy , you get any response yet ?
doesn 't seem much doubt about it , does there ?
oh god , oh god no .
it 's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too .
we 're going home . we 're in hyperspace .
and what do we do when we find it ?
my god , it 's stormy for a piece of rock that size !
source of transmission is to the northeast ... about 300 meters .
this ship is full of cat hair .
i understand why you did that .
look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn 't get it off him .
where did the parasites come from ?
this stuff 's deadly -- i hope we know what we 're doing .
so the only question left is : who gets to crawl down the airshaft ?
it was time for that a couple days ago .
but the lifeboat can 't accelerate to light speed .
can i ... um ... have some water ? please ?
nada . no radiation ... no movement ... nothing .
looks like a spore . fungus of some kind , maybe ?
let 's get back and call this in .
can you patch me a temporary loop on dcmgs ?
how many of them are there ?
i can 't reach her . too much signal break-up .
one of 'em must have escaped .
what the hell are you doing ?
can 't see a thing . are you sure ?
miss noguchi ! you 're wanted in admin .
fort powell . what do we tell 'em ?
it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here ...
they knocked out the external feeds .
there 's still time to back-out .
sorry . two green enabling buttons ...
okay , we 're in business .
okay , i 'm out of here !
so , what do you think ?
suites are for expense accounts . aren 't you being extravagant ?
she was a liar , she was a liar !
i 'm tired . i want to go home .
let 's go sit by the piano .
we never met . that 's why .
tell me this . do they have auditions for television ?
in my case it 's necessary . too many taxi drivers write plays .
then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast !
you mustn 't worry about your little charge . she is in safe hands .
i guess at this point i 'm what the french call 'de trop ' ...
when ? when are you going to do it ?
only in some ways . you 're prettier ...
bill ... bill , it 's your birthday .
bill ... ... where are you going ? to find eve ?
to margo . to my bride-to-be .
something simple . a fur coat over a nightgown ...
often enough to keep the franchise .
hello , what 's your name ?
you said forty-seven minutes . you 'll never make it .
thanks for your help ... good luck .
yes . yes , it does .
lem me fix you a drink .
margo does not play a lunatic , birdie .
bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
it was fort sumter they fired on-
how do you do , my dear .
she , too , is a great admirer of yours .
kill the people . got your key ?
adorable . we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop .
it 's after one now . you won 't get home till all hours .
i thought you 'd forgotten about me .
eve ... why don 't you start at the beginning ?
you 're not going , are you ?
eve . i 've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
she knows enough not to be here .
well ... it started with the play before this one ...
it 's been a real pleasure , eve .
back to copacabana . but eve . margo , let me tell you about eve-
did you see it here in new york ?
the hors d'oeuvres are here . is there anything else i can do ?
it 's the tight girdle that does it .
would you like a drink ? it 's right beside you ...
i don 't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn 't ?
now let 's not get into a big hassle-
after all , maybe she just wants to apologize ...
who is it ? what 's it all about ?
would you , really ? how sweet-
how about calling it a night ?
i like that girl . that quality of quiet graciousness ...
the general atmosphere is very macbethish . what has or is about to happen ?
supposed you dropped dead . what about your inventory ?
margo . you by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house ?
what is it about my writing that 's so rotten ?
we never reveal our sources , which is why you can talk to us .
did he just say what i think he said ?
think sloan 's back ? what 's wrong ?
-- there had to be a white house overseer --
he 'll give us a sworn statement .
you want barker 's phone stuff or his money stuff ?
could you reach mr. dardis by car radio ?
down to miami and back -- how much damage can i do ?
-- you got more than one source ? --
-- he was going to go into law practice with segretti .
-- and we got a guy in justice --
-- if he did it or just said he did it , god knows .
you 've really got to go .
-- then again , maybe things are even worse than we 've written --
ordinarily , though , what was the procedure ?
what happens when the baby comes ?
-- i 'm not your source on that --
-- that leaves haldeman , period .
-- if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund ? --
then it 's our asses , isn 't it ?
-- i don 't know , i don 't know , it feels thin --
it will , it just hasn 't bottomed out yet , give it time .
-- i saw him . he verifies .
we can 't talk inside either ?
i 'm so glad you could come , mr. --
we 're going to need lots of good luck , aren 't we ?
-- has any of them got an ax ? --
isn 't that what you 'd expect them to say ?
-- and it wasn 't ehrlichman or colson or the president .
uh ... you know , my friends call me nova -- as in casanova .
you 're just gon na sit there and drink your coffee ?
i had no idea you 'd be this good !
this is your plan , finch ?
you know , jim ... you could go back there ... and ...
what do you suppose they 're saying ?
me too . for the most part .
hey , what 're you doing here ?
hmm . you know that 's really a shitty middle name !
i can 't think of anything to say that 's not cheesy .
jessica , can you drive me home ?
oooh , yeah . oh , baby , you 're so good .
give it to me ! yes !
don 't you love my sexy body ? !
at least now i know what the hell they 're saying .
oh boy oh god oh crap oh no .
please , god . let this be it .
no , no that 's fine . so you doing okay ?
son . this lady 's here for you .
you guys got the latin homework ?
this was remade ? into what ?
feels like warm apple pie , dude .
hey , you did better than i did , nova .
hey guys , you came to watch me in action ?
you 've still got a chance with nadia , right ?
i still think you 're okay .
no ... you ... go ... ahead .
you are very good in the world history class , yes ?
so you need to change , right ?
you are done , james . perhaps i should be going now .
stifler , you 're such an asshole .
it 's a big , thick envelope , vicky . you got in .
and i want to try to make it up to you .
oh kevin -- don 't stop !
about the other day ... i 've been thinking .
see -- this is the nicest room .
hey . i got another question for you .
then she said -- she loves me .
you ever hear of something called the bible ?
dude , i wish you wouldn 't do that .
dude , it 's not like i haven 't been trying to get laid .
the sha-lin masters from east and west must unite !
so does your tongue cramp up ?
and by the way , sherman didn 't even get laid .
i guess we 'll call you two-ply .
wow . you two really have something going , don 't you ?
yeah , but we 'll still see each other .
you actually said that ? ! haaaah ! !
our last game is this saturday .
i don 't know if i want to be doing this .
tell you what , we 'll jump together .
merde ! i can 't believe this !
actually , i 'm waiting for someone .
god . how can you eat like that ?
wow . you know kung fu or something ?
ahh ! jesus ! you 're burning hot ! what the hell -
thanks for the lovely evening , shithead !
face it boyfriend . this is really happening .
hey , you can 't kick me ! you 're an apparition !
what good can you do ? why are you being so fucking stupid ?
wait a second , are you like the steven king of france or something ...
so you came after all . just in time , it 's getting interesting .
what happened ? did you cut yourself ?
don 't you want to change ?
shit ! you bought enough pate for a fucking army !
you two faced bastard . i knew you were full of shit .
because , andy . it 's a cure .
andy ... i should never have let you go underground . i 'm sorry ...
what the fuck ! ? you too ! ?
i hope they fucking fry us all .
we don 't both have to die .
didn 't even have to ask .
no wonder he let her go .
these tunnels must loop around and connect .
hey ! you shouldn 't be down there !
get me the fuck out of here ! !
okay , what the hell are you up to ?
in paris we have an expression for people like you : encul d'americain .
do you think i 'm an idiot ?
another step and he 's dead !
he was a good man . now his wife is a widow .
i don 't believe we 've been introduced .
it killed him ... you coulda just used draino . it 's cheaper .
alright . let me write a letter .
andy , stop ! i think he can help you -
two more nights in this lunar cycle .
oh , grandmama , why do you have to go back to paris ?
where is your home , anya ?
who did you hear it from ?
i was just wondering since we already have the dress . . .
we 're just going to refresh your memory ...
and a song someone sings once upon a december .
you never thought of the possibility ?
i 'm going to stretch my legs
just what do you think you 're doing ? !
you must enjoy causing me pain !
you never said anything to me about having to prove i 'm a princess !
you said you wouldn 't laugh !
i 'm glad you found what you were looking for .
par away , long ago glowing deep as an ember
dmitri didn 't want the money ?
i 've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
boy , don 't you hate it when that happens ?
bartok ... have you ever been to paris ?
she doesn 't want to do anything `` dishonest '' . . .
well , she certainly has a mind of her own .
see ? the princess is under there ...
how is our current financial status ?
may i present her royal highness princess anastasia !
not only is he a great agent , but he really gives good meetings .

she 's even better looking in the flesh .
well the neighborhood is full of dogs , and it 's not always otis .
oh my god , sorry . i 'm interrupting .

happy anniversary . thank you for making me a part of it .

there 's no smoking in this building .
hey , that 's dr. gardner , isn 't it ?
how is your -- personal life ?
we were in some of the same classes .
what are you talking about , nick -- what 's wrong with you ?
beth . i didn 't mean what i said . about --
what do you want , nick ?
why did you change your name ?
you should do something about this lock .
put your fucking hands up ! don 't move .
how long were you dating him ?
do you always keep old newspapers around ?
i thought you were out of cigarettes .
i told you -- i quit .
what 's your new book about ?
i told them you wouldn 't want to hide .
but you said you liked men to use their hands .
writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him .
you like playing games , don 't you ?
how did you feel when he died ?
even though you were fucking him .
would you like a drink ? i was just going to have one .
i 'd like to ask you a few more questions .
say -- `` what do you want from me , catherine ? ''
maybe she saw something she didn 't see before .
did you think it was so special ?
how about roxy ? is she a fuck to the century , too ?
are you kidding ? you think this is my idea of morning-after conversation ?
i thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty .
you shouldn 't play this game .
you 're in over your head .
it 's ok . it 's ok .
i thought you didn 't do adolescent secrets .
can i talk to you a minute ?
you like to hang out with murderers or what ? did you know roxy --
what do we do now , nick ?
there is no smoking in this building , ms. tramell .
would you tell us the nature of your relationship with mr. boz ?
did you kill mr. boz , ms. tramell ?
you have the right to an attorney .
what you doin ' , son ?
do you remember a case -- 1956 -- hazel dobkins ?
what 's goin ' down , son ?
i don 't think it 's funny .
it doesn 't make sense . she didn 't know me three months ago .
catherine says you don 't like her .
i don 't understand what the hell 's going on here , pop .
i 'm not sure anymore she did it .
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch .
you 're already gettin ' psychological input , son .
were you with him last night ?
so what do we do -- nothing ?
we know you 're not stupid , ms. tramell .
we 're sorry to disturb you , we 'd like to ask you some --
why do you think he 's dead ?
how old was she when this happened ?
he died -- about five or six years ago .

and the beast slouches towards bethelem .
i really do apologize , mr. wayne . his project was terminated this morning ...
i 'll show you it works .
wait ! you said you 'd let me go !
where are you sending batboy this time ?
go ahead . you can say it .
we want to dust him . we truly want to dust him bad .
it 's all right , alfred . everything 's under control .
... not even a 'thank you ' ?
i 'll have to ask you for that film .
how 'd you find this place ?
there 's terror everywhere . if you train yourself to look for it .
i don 't sing very well .
all street mimes should be executed .

you haven 't started in on the internal organs ?

i didn 't mean that the way it sounded .
my god . how i 'd love to see that .
are you comfortable ? do you ... want to move to the bedroom ?

mrs. kane would like to see you , mr. kane .

we might be able to go that way .
frank ! no , frank ! frank !
mr. travers is not the athletic type , he needs something more direct .

the rembrandt -- that was quite good .
why don 't we take oxygen ?

i didn 't mean to get personal .
that 's it . we 're ready .
i trust it 's your size .
certainly the most beautiful crook i 've ever seen .
to us . to the mask .
can you see the other pirs ?
be careful not to break the laser beams .
now 's when you tell me who you really are .
i like banks . that 's where the money is .

relax , don 't jam it ...
don 't panic , now , there 's no rush ...
the door 's the only way out !
i can not get rid of you .
i 'm not real big on collecting banged up ferraris at airports .
i 'd say she 's a size 6 who wears a size 4 .
my friend , you always surprise me .
so . you must 've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon .
this is a real nice place you got here .
it 's a good day . i feel good .
i don 't even know how much money that is .
come on , i 'm trying to help here .
so what 's the story on this thing ? this cancer stuff ?
i want a raise . and benefits . including dental .
then i don 't get anything either .
you 're doing the right thing , mr. masry .
is that what i think it is ?
hey . i like working with you .
jesus . they look like the secret service .
i 'll see what i can do .
holy shit . who do they represent , god ?
when 'd they file the demur ?
and you were told to destroy those ?
how come you didn 't say anything when you found these things ?

barks at the mention of food . licks his lips .
three patrol ships are heading our way .
turns on lando , the newcomer , with an ominous growl .
we should have stayed and finished them off .

... like we 're being watched .
the night storms will start before you can reach the first marker .
transport xj . get out of here . go !
what are you so grouchy about ?
you , too , golden rod .
it sounds like it 's trying to get in .
we 're doomed . goodbye , mistress leia . goodbye , captain ...
i can see the edge of the asteroid field , sir .
now all we 've got to worry about is what attacked him .
i don 't know what he 's talking about .
you must have gone completely out of your feeble mind .
hey ! someone 's still in here .
would it help if i got out and pushed ?
that was no laser blast ... . some- thing hit us ... .
easy , your worship . only trying to help .
sometimes , maybe ... occasionally , when you aren 't acting like a scoundrel .
looks like some kind of mynock .
i see it chewie , hang on .
what 'd you have in mind for your next move ?
you do have your moments ... not many , but you do have them .
i hope luke made it to the fleet all right .
i hope you make your peace with jabba .
sorry friend , i had no choice . they arrived right before you did .
all this just to get the kid ? what 's so important about him ?
lord vader has set a trap for him and ...
chewie 's right . we must try to save han .
we 've got to find luke .
no argument , just do it . that 's a command !
have they analyzed the one that was killed ?
we 've picked up something outside the base in zone one , moving east .
two transports at a time is awfully risky .
you don 't have to do this to impress me .
rather touchy , aren 't they .
artoo , you did it ! i never doubted you for a second ...
leia ... what would you think if i went away for a while ?
i will not fail you . i 'm not afraid .
i can 't . it 's too big .
four this time ! the force you feel .
all too easy . perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought .
so am i . and i mean you no harm .
but he isn 't us . he 's your own kind .
his reactor 's starting to overheat .
i wouldn 't be doin ' that , snake .
wait a minute . all right . hold on .

this is a dead end . you took us into a dead end !
be careful of the bald cats . they live in these buildings .
how do we get out of here ?
run , snake ... they 're coming .
get ready , shitheads . we 're comin ' in .
when you threw it in , what did you see ?
yield . i have the advantage .
thanks to god , you are alive .
lancelot , how did you fare in the north ?
they miss the battlefield . i think we do too .
hasn 't merlin mended your wound ?
then as knight to knight i can offer you mercy .
a king must marry , after all .
i should have left you to fend for yourself .
the knights of galys approach the camp . it would be politic ...
where hides evil , then , in my kingdom ?
merlin , tell me . now that guenevere is returned to me ...
i can not offer you the land , only my love ...
i left it in the tent , sir .
he is the mightiest and fairest of knights .
sir gahalt , answer the queen .
why didn 't he kill us ?
the king without his sword , the land without a king ...
just a man . a knight in the king 's service .
what do you want ? you must desire it for me to weave it .
it 's done . a truce . we meet at the river .
merlin ! out of the sick sleep at last .
the oath . you didn 't say --
this was under regan 's pillow . did you put it there ?
would you like some more coffee ?
oh , she 'd love it .
bastard ! i will kill you .

she 's heavily sedated . she 'll probably sleep through tomorrow .
we still think the temporal lobe ...
yes . he 's already here .
she doesn 't remeber a thing .
goodbye father . i call you .
how long are you planning to stay in regan ?
i am no one ! i am no one ! he is a priest !

... and the power to confront this cruel demon .

merrin ! ! ! ! ! ! !

miss wollsten shares the room with you ?
you are fortunate in your father .
i have forgotten it , dear .

canyon ahead . i circled once to buy some time to think .
tell me the settlement is right there ! riddick , please !
strong survival instinct . admire that in a woman .
just a suggestion , but perhaps we should flee .
christ , you don 't know what 's out there !
probably makes it worse . dehydrates you even more .
no , no , i wanted to get away .
rag it , riddick . nobody wants your theories on --
dancin ' on razor blades here ...
stop it , stop it , stop it !
we can not go through there ... .

aw , this can 't be happening to me ... .

what 's her name , anyway ?
you were tryin ' to kill him too .
he exceeded his orders . his travel permit was promptly revoked .
how did you know we 'd come here ?
you 've never told me why this region 's called the forbidden zone .
when are you going to show me what 's in the cave ?
taylor , i 'd rather you -
that was different . we thought you were ... . inferior .
cornelius , why do you insist on provoking him ?
a toy . it floats on the air . try it .
where there 's one there 's another . and another . and another .
well , at least they haven 't tried to bite us .
which one was wearing the strange clothes ?
this place is dirty , doctor .
state your case , mr . prosecutor .
objection ! these remarks are profane and irrelevant .
you could get hurt doing that , doctor .
awww , it still hurts , doesn 't it ?
it 's no use ... there she goes .
well ? where are we ? have any notion , skipper ?
if only we could get a fix .
we got off at the wrong stop .
shouldn 't we be moving on ?
why did you do that ? scrape off your hair ?
dr. zira -- tell bright eyes to sit down .
this is a joke in very poor taste .
there is no contradiction between faith and science . true science .
then answer this : if ran was superior , why didn 't he survive ?
well , bright eyes , is our throat feeling better ?
what 's the diagnosis , doctor ? a touch of the sun ?
then tell them dr. zaius won 't leave here alive .
dr. zira , i 'd like to kiss you good-bye .
wouldn 't it more properly be done in your office ?
let them talk , mr president . let them talk .
but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland . how will you survive ?
but the proof ? the doll ?
... but 'lias is still out there .
i shit on all o ' you .
you 're dead , you 're fucking dead elias !
come on you can do better than that !
does he have a metal plate in his head ?
taylor - get your ass over here . move !

... you know that night we got hit ... i ...
three years , jesus , he 's crazy as barnes ...
you volunteered for this shit man ?
what we got here a crusader ?
excuses are like assholes , taylor - everybody got one .
tell six we need engineers here , this pos . is crawling with traps .
sounds pretty far out to me 'lias .
whatcha doing in the underworld taylor ?
the good lord works his revenge in strange ways .
not the only man to meet his jezebel either .
and baaaaaaa ! back on you .
well he ain 't normal that 's fo sure .
no thanks , i 've seen seattle .
same as an hour ago . remember ? i 'm the steady type .
i think i 'd like to dance .
what 's the matter , baby ? don 't you like being kissed ?
they might think i was running away from something .
go ahead ... if you want to . it doesn 't matter .
you 'll never make it . you 've out- smarted yourself .
but i tell you -- -if you 'd only understand .
i 'd like a few words with you , in private .
hi margo . hello killaine . you two come together ?
let me introduce you . mr. killaine , mrs. west .
how are your teeth getting along ?
what 's this in favor of ?
it goes with this ... cold houses and warm drinks ... the effete englishman .
how about a cup of coffee ?
how are you two getting along ?
hello , mitchell . having fun ?
i think we 'd better discuss this in my office , mr. mitchell .
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair .
i needn 't keep you any longer , mr. clarendon .
catch me at the vancouver royal if it 's important .
i 'm looking for mr. brandon .
i knew him . he was easy to dislike , poor chap .
that 's pretty risky business , inspector .
scotch and plain water , i think .
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield ?
i believe you won decorations during the war .
what 'll we do about it , margo ?
she is beautiful . and young . no thank you .
you 're very attractive , my dear . and you look very unsophisticated .
he 's a little unhappy . i hope he wasn 't a nuisance ?
here i am lecturing you . have some pt .
but i 'm not an interviewer or a correspondent .
aha . james giving some woman the old heave-ho .
so it 's all worked out perfectly ...
can i give you a lift ?
i might see you in norfolk over the weekend .
shall we have a drink or something ?
we don 't seem to get much time to talk .
c'mon . i don 't want any jones about this .
don 't point it at james !
so what 's the biggest ? waimea ?
i got ta be fucking crazy .
we gon na jump or jerk off ?
you 're a fucking dead man --
you call him ... right now ... and tell him to let her go .
three seconds ... two ... one ...
oh well he must be a surfer .
... four months . june to october . mmmm ... same the year before .
johnny , it 's the only way .
i think you got ta hit them straight on !
big zippo so far . how about you ?
no , but there are four guys back there you might check out .
when did harp say they 'd have the warrant ?
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up ?
they 're on their way to maui .
i know where they 're going .
i can barely do this in broad daylight .
well , i saw you and --
billy ... what the hell 's wrong with you ?
billy 's on it . heat seeker . pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys .
blain ... ... just like the others ... no powder burns , no shrapnel .
you 're wastin ' your time .
what 's got billy so spooked ?
you 're looking well , dutch .
that 's over the border , general .
what have you got in mind , general .
there 's no way you could know that .
it 's ... it 's not like that .
you don 't know anything about me .
who are you going after next , sir ?
what would it take to buy our stock back ? name your price .
i ... i would take advantage of it .
i ... i don 't know . there ... there wasn 't time ...
mind if i turn on some heat ?
ugly habit , biting your nails .
sounds like you 've known a lot of lawyers .
i think he wanted you to tip him .
where are they ? shopping together ?
it 's a very good year .
the one i 'm buying this week will cost around 150 million .
and that 's the way the game is played .
keep talkin ' . i like hearin ' .
you asshole ! i can 't believe what a -- !
i 've never been on a plane before .
love this car ! is it new ?
bill , i 'd like you to meet vivian .
why do you want to know ?
i don 't think there 's any sense in --
you spent it on drugs , didn 't you ?
you sure you won 't come with me ?
would you like to try it on ?
yeah . sure . why not . call me at the regent beverly wilshire .
my westley will always come for me .
every ship but the four you sent .
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .
... as ... you ... wish ...
farm boy . fill these with water -- -- please .
singed a bit , were you ?
we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here .
frankly , i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting .
look are you just fiddling around with me or what ?
why is that , do you think ?
why should that make such a difference ?
no more rhymes now , i mean it .
you be careful . -- people in masks can not be trusted .
fezzik , are there rocks ahead ?
tilt his head back . open his mouth .
you 've been mostly dead all day .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had ?
don 't pester him , he 's had a hard day .
he 's getting away from me , fezzik . please . fezzik !
it doesn 't sound too bad . i 'll try and stay awake .
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
oh no . no , please .
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .
for the last time -- surrender !
your guess is as good as mine --
he 's dead . he can 't talk .
i do not suppose you could speed things up ?
you don 't know any way you 'll trust me ?
we 'll wait until you 're ready .
do you always begin conversations this way ?
i thought it fitting , considering the rocky terrain --
i admit it -- you are better than i am .
making sure nobody 's following us .
go in , get after her !
he 's climbing the rope . and he 's gaining on us .
he didn 't fall ? inconceivable ! !
perhaps an arrangement can be reached .
but sir , i 'm not condem ...
what is that ? a handkerchief ?
what are you doing with those books ? where are you going ?
i vas vit him a great deal , you know .
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one ...
franz , trust me . i promise i won 't let you down .
five o'clock . killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut .
yes . the actors . i must destroy the actors .
where 's goebbels ? where 's my little joe ?
did he say anything about my sister ?
yes ... i just ... did . the moment they told me ...
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type .
i won 't feel satisfied unless i got out there , sam .
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting ?
we should have asked for cabin one ... the one mary was in .
your home address . oh , just the town will do .
i 'm sorry . i wish ... people could apologize for other people .
they thought she 'd be coming to me .
did you wish to see someone ?
gosh , you had me fooled .
yes -- i can 't stand it -- everybody wants papers -- oh , oh
disappoint me ? why , what do you mean , dear ?
we 'll be coming to the opening .
but i think these things are beautiful .
please , oh , please , i haven 't done anything to hurt you .
hey , what do you think you 're doing ? put that stuff back !
which one is me ? the horse ?
well , why so mysterious ! come on , spill it .
i am right ! i know i 'm right !
ralph , come here a minute , will you ?
there she is ! you 'll find joan gale in that box .
what is it ? what happened ?
she is the soul of that statue .
i 've been dreaming about you .
we flopped the first time out .
no . i didn 't . i 'm listening .
rose , are you all right ? are you sick or something ?
rose , you must know who the fellow is .
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy , rose .
son , was rose in your room last night ?
i heard you talking . hasn 't rose come in ?
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce . do you believe that , doll ?
i think she 's gon na kiss him .
now i can 't see . what are they doing ?
she 's putting the titty back .
no , mother , he 's lying ...
why is it taking so long ?
what 's the matter , hon ? is anything wrong ?
excuse me , sir , are you calling my wife a liar ?
she hasn 't actually done anything ...
she does look a little peaky .
i 'd say about three months . are you satisfied ?
this conversation is making me a little sick .
how can the buttons stand the pressure ?
what have you got in your hair , girl ?
you were up late last night , too , rose .
there ain 't nobody here , mr. hillyer ! honest , there ain 't !
took your time gettin ' here .
yes , dear , what is it ?
what 's the matter with him ?
yes , thank you , doctor .
mother ... is rose going to die ?
i don 't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children .
i don 't want to go to the dentist .
rose has learned her lesson , haven 't you , rose ?
rose , you don 't have to .
have i ever steered you wrong ?
this is private property . this is breaking and entering !
hey now ... what the fuck ... ?
just a little , you know ... bicentennial memento . nothing special .
i ... i can 't find my seatbelt .
we shoulda been there to back you up . we shoulda !
ah , jeez , billy ... careful !
no offices are gon na be open today .
laugh it up . you 'll cry later .
okay . but , what changed our mind ?
whoa , whoa ... it 's gon na be alright .
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ?
you could start over again with cash like that .
pardon me ... my mistake . taking your thoughts in hand , huh ... ?
hold your horses , sweetpea . we need butch cassidy alive , remember ?
i 'm gon na get beside him .
get closer ! don 't lose him !

hey-ho ... ! maybe we 're not alone in this thing after all .
what the hell 's his problem ?
you 're ... you 're not doing what i think you 're doing ... ?
no more counting the big money for someone else .
admiral , we 're in position . all fighters accounted for .
all craft , prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark .
at that close range , we won 't last long against those star destroyers .
the shield is down ! commence attack on thedeath star 's main reactor .
i can 't do it , artoo . i can 't go on alone .
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father .
i told you to remain on the command ship .
i have felt him , my master .
they are clear , my master .
why don 't you leave that crate and come with us ?
chewie and i will take care of this . you stay here .
i thought she was with you .
take the squad ahead . we 'll meet at the shield generator at 0300 .
somehow , i got the feeling that didn 't help us very much .
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .
shall we try and go around ?
han ! hurry ! the fleet will be here any moment .
the code 's changed . we need artoo !
guess i owe you some thanks , too , lando .
well , look at you , a general , huh ?
my goodness ! artoo , why did you have to be so brave ?
oh , princess leia , are you all right ?

oh brad , i 'm mad .

oh brad , i 'm frightened . what kind of place is this ?
great heavens , that 's a laser .

the papers said the safe door was opened , eddie .
jesus , eddie , is this who i think it is ?
so you decided to help him after all ?
can you get him out of it , eddie ?
so what 's the scam , eddie ?
maybe they just took it out of his pocket .
come on , doom . what would a company like that want with toontown ?
don 't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?
oh ... well , i ... i just had to see you .

are you sure you won 't have a drink ?
so this is what , a test ?
if i was healthy , i could take that away from you .
yeah , well ... my way works too .
he trusts you to lock up ?
pretty much what you 'd expect .
what 'd you say to him ?
the question still remains : what do we do now ?
you sure your friend got the right place ?
not here . they might see it .
you have to stop doing that !
i told you , i quit .
why didn 't you kill her ?
i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new .
whatsamatter with you ? aren 't you concerned about all of this ?
don 't spend it all in one place .
how old is otis anyhow , thirty ?

we 'll torch the bases , how 's that ?
i should have known something like this was going to happen !
he 's going to be trouble .
we had a deal ! what was i , talking to the wall ?
you 're out of your mind .
how long is it going to take ? !
what are you thinking ? we were only supposed to scare him !
just one more . this one knocks off all the rest .
well , i don 't know ...
you don 't expect us to believe that do you ?
could it have been in the mercedes ?
there 's an atm on speedwell avenue .

sally , do you love me ?
what is this ? don 't be stupid man ...

carter ... here comes the rich white man .
i could use a little vacation .
i know who you are , inspector lee .
i 'm asking for real now -- will you help the secret service ?
i didn 't know which side you were on .

lee , this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service .
all he wanted was some mu-shu .
escort detective carter to the airport --
despite what people suspect ... what you suspect --
if you reach for that gun , i 'm going to kill you .

you don 't move , you understand ? ! you don 't move !

i am afraid i don 't understand the importance of this information .
i thought you were taking me to the consulate .
let 's go . everybody take off ?
no , please , i don 't --
no , wait . i don 't have it . you have it .
well.. i wouldn 't want to be in the way .
i 'm talking about the girl .

what 's this little green wire coming out one side of the package ?
come on . let 's get you some dry clothes .
i will not have friends in america .
what is he up to now ?
bob -- are you making friends with this man ?
at this pace , it could be an evening wedding .
what do you expect me to say to this ?
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs .
that 's it . back to obedience school .
and in a `` v '' .
i love his eyes . i just believe they 're listening to you .
no , that 's what makes you unemployed .
well -- i 'm sorry , i 'm really sorry , ellie .
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support .
it 's okay . there 's no microphone . you 're no fun .
i am just such a reporter . and you are ?
i think you 'd look good in red .
it 's nice that they 're still friends .
they made me put my hat back on .
dad 's fishing trip , grandma 's knee operation , grandma 's birthday ...
weird dreams ? you 're going to tell me about them ?
look , look , man . i think the man is heartbroken .
you 've been here for three minutes . what did you do to her ?
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers .
it 's a birthday present for my cousin . put your finger in .
watch your leg , dad . i 'm so tired of this .
i 'm sorry , bob . she kissed me back .
i love you . i love you .
to who ? are you asking me ?
so -- mag -- you 've seen this , huh ?
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they 're getting haircut .
i 'm really rooting for this one .
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
is that all right with you ?
miss scarlett . in the broom closet . with the radio .
beautiful view , isn 't it ?
oh , walter . i don 't deserve you .
it 's not true , but it feels true .
you don 't know who she was , annie --
this is a photo of hair .
everybody ! annie has an announcement --
it 's probably just the flowers --
hey , my plate is full .
dad , could you close the door ?
just out of curiosity , how did they get our address ?
how did they get our phone number ?
i ... uh ... have a date with someone friday night .
this one 's for both of us .
why is she bringing that bag ?
don 't ever do that again .
i can 't believe you flew first class .
hi , sam . and let me guess -- you must be jonah .
god , it 's wonderful to see you . where 's greg ?
you saw her in the airport and then here ?
take a drink . calm down !
mama , can i put the candles ...
come on , esperanza -- how about it ? we got to .
mother of god ... have mercy ...
i 'm telling you . i don 't stay home with these kids tomorrow .
but if you go back they 'll lock you up again .
fuck man . come on , bobby .
i guess i don 't have a hell of a lot of choice .
jesus , i look like a raccoon .
could be worse . oh sorry , forgot who i was talking to .
then make sure he gets put away for longer .
you think you 're the only one down here with a sad story ?
no . i want to know what the hell is going on .
really , i don 't want to .
you 're good , princess . i 'll give you that .
all right , nancy , how 'd you track me down ?
how the hell did we get this detail ?
nice dealer you got there , jimmy .

jimmy , where do you find these people ?
you wan na score some go-fast ?
hey , why do you need a gun and a vest anyway ?

jimmy , look , there 's something i have to tell you .
captain steubing thinks you might work for the police .

cool it . we got business .
feeling the paranoia tonight , are we ?
if he finds out it 's me , i 'm a dead man .
you think this is funny motherfucker ?
you better not be blowing smoke up my ass , flynne .
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off ?
that 's real sweet , garcetti . thanks .
whatever you say , man . look ... can we talk about this ?
please ... don 't do this ...
then why didn 't you help the kid when you were there ?
we know what 's going on .
speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me ?
come on ! who is it ? domingo 's boys ?
when is the deal going down ?
you thinking what i 'm thinking ?
and believe me , word will get out that you 're a pro rat .
golly , i hadn 't thought of that .
jesus jimmy , you at the alpha team .
alright , i 'll give you that . continue .
you know what the best possible thing that could happen is ?
he ain 't half-bad , i guess .
well , i 'll be goddamned , i knew it .
you can tell all that , just by the sound , sire ?
i wasn 't made for this .
no , but he heard firing , just east , less that a kilometer .
i wonder where they 're going .
i 'd like to stay , too , captain .
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner .
what 'd you say , captain ?
captain , what about our deal ?
you get a translator , captain ?

makes you feel small , doesn 't it ?
pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .
sarge , see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable .
captain , can i put in for a transfer ?
i don 't think so , captain .
general gavin is going to be very irritated at you , captain .
jesus christ , he 's a natural !
well , maybe not the captain , but the rest of us have mothers .
sir , i 've got an idea , let 's go around .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
scans the germans with his binoculars .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
i wonder if his cabin is still available ?
continues firing . cutting down the advancing germans .
i 'd like to go , sir .
is jumped on by one . upham fires . kills the german .
doesn 't move . he just stares at sarge 's body .
oh , christ , now we got ta listen to that grandfather thing again .
jesus , reiben , think of the poor bastard 's mother .
so , where are you from ?
sir , i ran the 220 in high school .
you think he really believed it ?
thanks , i like yours too .
i 'll be in my office .
no , no , don 't go in there .
wait for me for when i get round to the front .
i draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls .
trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess .
i wouldn 't get my hopes up lloyd .
i told him to be himself .
lloyd , she 's being difficult .
dad , you have to teach me to suture this weekend .
god , i 'll have to go on a plane .
did he ever get rough with you ?
if i pick it up , we 'll only get back together .
dad , are you okay in there ?
actually , i think that i ...
boy , this is a mother dictionary .
let 's get outta here . you want to ?
you 're freaking out here man .
we finally graduated , big dude guy !
the gentleman thinks a mistake 's been made .
it 's not a charade , all this ?
ghetto police . i 'm a policeman now , can you believe it ?
what do i got for you ?
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs ?
good . how 's it going ?
i don 't know anybody who 'd be interested in that .
don 't ever do that to me again .
this , i don 't know , maybe you can trade it for something .
i got to go , i 'll see you .
eight hundred , give or take .
that 's very generous of you .
i 'll talk to you later .
he 's stealing from you , oskar .
i can do it , captain .
how 's the name search going ?
jesus christ . captain tyler flies out of his seat and into action .
i would say we are now officially baffled .
no , some creep asshole trying to scare me .
don 't do anything stupid , cotton . you 've come to far .
jesus , youre just as whacked as your son .
how do you put up with this greek shit ?
it 's okay . i can peddle toilet paper .
this is exactly what i don 't want .
poor cotton , could life be a little more cruel ?
yeah , you look quizzical yet pensive .
not good . how you doin ?
maybe they never got here . he could have taken her anywhere .
what do you want from me ?
sid , i 'll come with you .
lucas and his romper room stage .
he tried to kill her first .
i got a surprise for you .
you 're going to get it . you know what happens .
it 's okay to break , girl . you shatter if you have to .
i 'm the only one who can cut him down .
how many guys they have on you ?
i 've been waiting for you , baby .
have they questioned you yet , sid ?
perfect . i 'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite .
sid , i 'll seeya tonight .
thanks for the movie , randy .
that 's sidney prescott 's mother .
what about angelina tyler ? she was there too .
i can see nothing 's changed .
don 't worry , i 've got a permit for it .
watch out sid . randy said the killer 's always superhuman .
don 't worry . i 'm prepared for anything .
so you knew sidney prescott 's mother .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
shit ! where the hell are tom and angelina ?
god damn it you two ! run ! hurry ! he 's dead !
nobody said she was an actor .
excuse me detective , i think we have some business to attend to .
answer the question . you knew sidney 's mom ?
oh my god ! sidney , you ran fast or what ? hey .
if you lay a hand on him i 'll fucking kill you !
alright i 'm here , now show your face so we can finish this .

she can 't get both of us .
i don 't know billy but i 'm hurtin ' .

subtlety , stu . look it up .
i wan na let go . i do ...
no ! don 't believe him .
why did you kill my mother ?
you bitch -- where the fuck are you ?
why do you want to know my name ?
is this some kind of a joke ?
i 'm two seconds from calling the police .
how do you know his name ?
... leave me alone ... please ...
don 't make me ... i can 't ... i won 't .
i 'm twenty-five years old , ma'am .
i just turned 25 . i was 24 for a whole year .
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism .
hey ... dewey . can we go now ?
a party ? mom 's gon na kill you . then me .
god , look at this place , it 's the town that dreaded sundown .
i see you as a young meg ryan myself .
it 's deputy riley today , sid .
casey ? where are you honey ? call the police , goddamnit .
off the record . no cameras .
cut some slack . she watched her mom get butchered .
where do you get this shit ?
why would you call me from my front porch ?
good try , randy . tell tatum to hurry . bye now .
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie .
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same .
i thought everything was checked out .
his movie nut mind has snapped , sid . he 's gone psycho .
come on , sid . give me the gun .
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .
if tatum sees you -- she 'll draw blood .
it 's okay . she was supposed to pick me up .
this is a mistake . i shouldn 't be here .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .
is billy going to be there tonight ?
what do you think about when you 're having sex ?
hunt ? why would they ask if you like to hunt ?
because there 's no way a girl could have killed them .
i thought you dumped her for me .
with that set of lungs -- she should be .
you don 't . it goes to court now .
he 's pissing in our faces again and we 're just taking it .
how is it working for a scumbag like this ? you proud of yourself ?
you 've left unfinished business before .
well , there he sits . it 's not supposed to make sense .
you 've made a good life for yourself ...
this doesn 't make any sense .
this is his stuff . i 've been out in the cold all day .
i 'm declining this case . i want us reassigned .
it 's too soon for him .
it 's a package deal . you get the phone with the office .
i 'd like you to meet somerset .
you 're sure your men didn 't move this ?
oh , yeah , sure . you got to be kidding ? !
how did the fire fight end ?
how much money do you have ?
well , that was money well spent .
we could use about fifty more men here .
he cut her up and dressed the wounds .
you knew i 'd say yes .
as soon as this is over , i 'm gone .
because he is john doe , by choice .
throw your weapon , detective ! now !
tell me it 's not true .
i 'm sorry about this , mrs. gould . i really am .
don 't worry . i don 't wear it at the dinner table .
how long have you lived here ?
i don 't know , with this case .
i feel strange being here with you ... without david knowing .
did their son see it happen ?
passed the todd place comin ' in ... what happened to 'em ?
you askin ' me to clear out now ?
now , ethan , i ain 't sure ...
not tonight ... ben , put that sword back .
why 'd they break off ? was there water in that canyon ?
it 's all right ... charlie , let 's move outside .
you 're goin ' if the captain says you 're goin ' ...
you can forget that ... wouldn 't be legal anyway .
you got any more orders , captain ?
if you were tryin ' to surround 'em , you sure succeeded .
fight fair , son ... use your fists !
is captain clayton here , reverend ?
and what makes you think he 's in this territory ?
martin ! ride me as far as the well !
i don 't care what they 've done to you ... what happened ...

what you goin ' to do ?

and you think we got a chance to find her ?
hey ! what 's the idea ... ?
not so funny ... if you recollect what 'nawyecka ' means ...
let 's go ... i think i stumbled onto somethin ' ...
well , you 're a widower now ...
how ? she 's even forgot her own language !
go on ! get out of here while you can ...
what 's that got to do with us ?
i 'd be obliged if you 'd get to the point , ma'am .
every young man should at least once ... go on , laurie ! read !
don 't go takin ' that stuff ...
might at least have left me my pants !
say it anyway . come on , how much do you love me ?
do you know where fuse box is ?
is everything alright ? aren 't you feeling well ?
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it .
martin , it 's not funny !
now , what did i do to deserve this ?
so , did you sleep good ?
don 't tell me you 've made friends with that wandering flea circus ?
where have you been all day ?
let me guess : another short circuit ?
oh , ellen . my sweet ellen ... of course i knew .
it 's important - he knows the last chapter .
you know , tommi wants me to become the man i used to be .
how did you get me out of there ?
for god 's sake , what happened to me ?
i really hate to bother him , but ...
frank kosinski . here 's the address . go see him . ask him .
hello . can i help you ?
no , i 've never seen him before .
do yourself a favor : don 't ask .
oh , mrs. straub . may i introduce you to my wife ?

you did not like the speech ?
we will all be put in the clink .

i do not know how to undress a man .
i am very sorry , sir , i have not seen act two .

do a little freebasemaybe , from time to time ?
so we 'll meet him , then ?
david , i promise we will . keep him happy .
well , you certainly had a good look around .
i don 't see the point in that .
aren 't you going to answer it ?
i don 't know . i thought maybe i was --
it makes us feel a whole lot better .
stop him , alex . you 've got to stop him .
loks like you had a break-in up here as well .
is this where no one stays ?
why do you want a room here ?

i 've never seen a dead body before .

i thought you 'd gone to work .
we already know . all about it .
you can tell by the intonation .
-- yes , senator -- just a minute , dear --

bernstein ... seemed to think i hated men .
no ! don 't ! please !
look , either come in or stay out !

well we 'd love to , but we 're going to another party .
i think that was farther west in the sierras .

how 's it going , doc ?

i made 'em just the way you like 'em , sunny side up .
what do you want me to do about it ?
don 't hurt me ! don 't hurt me !
i don 't believe they did .
good morning jack . i hope you haven 't been waiting too long .
i 'd better collect my family first .
yes , i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs .
oh ... well this is our gold ballroom .
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably .
it 's amazing how much activity is going on today .
bill , i 'd like you to meet jack torrance .
bill , would you have the torrances ' things brought in their apartment .

mary robert , i am so sorry about last night ...
wait , this isn 't the way . who are you ?
but what do they want ? where are we going ?
excused . open the cabinet to your left . you will find appropriate attire .
then i guess you 're stuck . life sentence . no parole .
i hate you . i totally hate you .
i just need a few more weeks ,
you mean -- worried about my testimony ?
don 't you have a concert to go to ?
we could put you into our witness protection program .
then one day they find you .
vince -- is she ... okay ?
i can 't see anything in here !
but , boss -- she 's still , you know , a nun .
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car .
strip down a nun ? you want us to fry ?
are you going to shoot us all , tough guy ?
it should be here any minute .
we sound terrible we need mary clarence .
look what she did with the choir . she made us sing beautifully .
we 've got to save her !
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ?
she shouldn 't have come back . she knew she was in danger .
is this like your old convent ?
mary clarence has a background in music . that 's what reverend mother said .
we did it ! we actually sang a chord !
but , reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style .
we can 't sing without her ! what should we do ?
you mean -- they kidnapped her ?
the little sisters of the moonlight !
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun ?
mary clarence -- you 're alive !
i don 't understand . where is she ?
las vegas -- she 's here somewhere .
absolutely not . i am very sorry , but no .
but , bishop , surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood .
i mean , won 't she talk ? she seemed kind of upset .
she 's a nun , vince .
she 's ... she 's a nun .
hail , constable . how are you ?
um ... i ... i did not ... no . why ?
we haven 't heard your name yet , friend .
they spend two days in chains .
why did you move the body , doctor ?
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves .
... help yourself , you pompous ass . i will be in bed .
taken . taken by the headless horseman . taken back to hell .
just a moment ... are you saying it is he ?
perhaps , i could assist in finding them ?
tell me something . what becomes of young masbath ?
what does it mean ... climb down to the horseman 's soulless place ?
there is no masbath here . my father 's loan papers are missing .
what now ? where is she ?
why ... why are you like this ?
forgive me , i didn 't know .
my god ... what has happened ?

i don 't really understand the meaning of the words .
doyle , don 't you lay one hand on her .
i 'm a witness . i heard you threaten her life .
i ain 't never used no hatchet that i remember .
don 't hit that boy no more .
she said she 'd see me later . that 's kinda good , right ?
hey , mama . hey , vaughan .

i like walkin ' quite a bit from time to time .

she 's talkin ' about me , karl . that 's my first name .
what about you , karl ? do you want to stay here ?
he just got out of the state hospital .

thomas cole . my name is thomas jefferson cole .
be nice , sweetie . we 're just here to help you .
sure . he 's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle .
i didn 't expect to see you again .
uh , actually , i tend to shy away from that kind of thing .
fuck you , too , you white son-of-a-bitch .
we came here to deliver some clean laundry .
if it doesn 't make any difference , why not just say it ?
don 't know how long it 's take to get a charge ...
we discussed that . and decided not to .
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .
he 's still got a good grip . we need to dig more .
my mom . would be the problem .
i can just feel my spirits soar .
there can 't be any wrong in this , ha ...
it 's just pearl harbor . people are a little crazy , right n ...

isn 't there a psychological term for that , dr. johnson ?
400 years ago ? i 'm sure christopher columbus would 've loved these accomodations .
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas .
i didn 't do anything wrong . i didn 't mean ...

why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ?
the examination is a normal function .
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices .
does v'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units ?
you said v'ger 's purpose was to find and join with the creator .
it is a courier , captain . grade one priority . non-belligerency confirmed .
deck four , captain ; officers ' quarters ... !
sir ! airlock four has been opened ; a thruster suit is reported missing !
tractor beam strength lessening , captain .
that 's why you 're staying aboard . i 'm sorry , will .
... but i still recommend further simulation study .
explanation , mr. decker : why was my phaser order countermanded ?
i trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties , mister ?
recommend defensive posture , captain : screens and shields .
i advise caution , captain ; we can 't withstand another attack .
the ship is under attack ... ! man all defensive stations ... !
well , mr. decker , it seems my bluff is being called .
we could have cut it off at the main computer ...
mr. spock , what would v'ger need to fulfill itself ?
that transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and the creator .
i now the captain meant no person- al insult .
lieutenant ilia reporting for duty , sir .
and in you , too , lieutenant .
transmit , mr. spock ! now !
ahead warp one , mr sulu .
mr. sulu , steady as she goes .
clear the bridge , captain ... ?
we 're losing the pattern ... !
sir , i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview .
captain , i suspect there 's an object at the heart of that cloud .
it appears that our message has been understood , captain .
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude ...
captain , we have been seized by a tractor beam ... !
spock ? concerned about his chances ?
were you right ? spock ? v'ger is a living machine ... ?
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point , then ... ?
dock control reports ready , sir .
negative helm control , captain ! going reverse on impulse power ... !
starfleet has been apprised of our situation , captain .

what kind of egg is it ?
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones !
that 's not what i saw .
pendergast ? are you all right ?

our vaccine may have no effect !
don 't bring it home in this .
she the one from santa cruz ?
shouldn 't we get a catheter in him ?
i hate to admit it , but there 's something perversely satisfying about this .
instead of going into his mind ...
when did he lapse into the coma ?
what about the legalities of this ... ?
when we got here , you just topped and pulled her out .
i have done this , you know . been inside .
someone looking after her little girl ?
the dog 's an albino . he 'd love an animal like that .
after three years she remembers what the guy drove ?
jesus christ , man , you look like hell .

listen , harry - i didn 't believe that ...
... exactly who did you tell about me ? hmm ?
well , i 've got quite a lot on my mind .
have you ever seen any of your victims ?
it 's wonderful how you keep the tension .
... you know and all that .

could he have been at all conscious ?
what else did he tell you ?
he probably knows a lot more than that . somebody 's lying .
should i make it all fact ?
i 'll share something with you .
if you could see your way to lending me some cash -
thank you , sir . thank you . i promise i will repay you .
richard , it 's secret . that 's the whole point .
we leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim .
they only kill them when they love them ?

you 're not like the others , are you ? ... your friends .
i 'm coming to your room tonight .

that 's a fact , isn 't it ?
you won 't go to galbraith with me ?

he 's waitin ' for you in the card room .
you just worry about your end , kid .

i 'm not sure i know it .

you really picked a winner , kid .
you got nothin ' on me .
what is this ? i got work to do .

i didn 't know you invented that smelting process .

how are you ? here . get under this .
he didn 't do it -- nick !
man to man , mr. charles , are you working on this case ?

i think we may as well sit down .
we 're just having a little drink .
is there a mr. macaulay in the house ? oh , it 's you .
asta - don 't bother mr. macaulay .
i got word from wynant this morning ...

nick ! nick ! there 's someone to she you ,
i wish that doctor 'd come . how do you feel ?
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids .
oh , it 's a fire hydrant .
this may be a little rough - you 'd better let us go alone .
you don 't get another swallow 'til you really open up .
you give such charming parties , mr. charles .
serve the nuts - i mean , serve the guests the nuts .
you 're going to drive me crazy !
if that knife is missing , i 'll look for it in your back .
i 'm sorry . tanner , don 't you want some wine ?
you speak english ? do you speak english ! ?
think we 're going to do it ? think we 're going to war ?
it 's a map , i think that 's what it is .
yeah ! welcome to beautiful iraq . land of enchantment and riches .
why , yes , jaeger . i believe it is .
what are we going to do ! ?
you two fighting 's not going to get us anything .
all right . let 's get out of here .
there 's nothing we can do .
the us army : always an adventure .
otherwise whatever we 're looking for could be anywhere .
and they can 't fly around out there forever .
you got no reason to do that !
thanks for taking care of this for me .
don 't even . you 're not going to show me that tired map .
it 's going to be cool , wes . it 's all all right .
it 'd make their heads explode .
what do we do with the humvee ?
i said nobody dies . nobody dies .
you 're going to be fine .
you 're not losing trust , are you ?
iraqis . a bunch of them .
they 're doing more than slapping .
think there might be more iraqis ?
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
wes might be right about that .
i 'm sorry about that , epps .
what do you think our chances are ?
wonder how the war 's going ?
i didn 't say that . i never said --
which way do we go ! ?
epps , i don 't think he 's slowing down .
that shouldn 't be too hard to read . iraq is the pink thing .
and you 're the guy who 's going to open it .
it 's ... it 's ... i don 't know what it is .
god ! i don 't believe i 'm doing this . i don 't .
we 're going to get court martialed , you know that .
epps , is that a sand dune .
if there 's gold . if !
i 'm getting tired of you riding me , jaeger .
is there anything you do know ?
maybe they 're as scared of us as we are of them .
what the hell are you doing ! ?
with what ? he doesn 't have a weapon .
says he 's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter .
you 're going to burn up in those .
think the iraqi 's killed them all ?
no , your going to eat it , or it will go to waste .
then why did you bring it up ?
it 's all right now , shhhh it 's all right .
there goes another of your disciples .
i thought you were through with it !
i can just barely see him . i think he 's leaving .
wait ! i 'll talk to him .
that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
i can 't see him at all . he 's been destroyed .
how far did you go ? was it cold ?
would you like part of this ? ... .it 's not much .
