let me see what i can do .
well , there 's someone i think might be --
i counted on you to help my cause . you and that thug are obviously failing . aren 't we ever going on our date ?
you 're sweet .
eber 's deep conditioner every two days . and i never , ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment .
i don 't have to be home 'til two .
i did .
hopefully .
you know the deal . i can ' t go if kat doesn 't go --
at least i 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig .
i really don 't think i need any social advice from you right now .
so did you
it 's just you .
exactly my point
if kat 's not going , you 're not going .
it 's just a party . daddy .
it 's her favorite band .
hell , i 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
yeah -- we 'll see .
i 've retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you 'll find helpful .
don 't make me do it , man
it 's off . the whole thing .
i don ' t know . i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it .
fine , thirty .
fifty , and you 've got your man .
hey -- it 's all for the higher good right ?
just a little .
you could always go with me . i 'm sure william has some friends .
depends on the topic . my fenders don 't really whip me into a verbal frenzy .

but it 's gigglepuss - i know you like them . i saw you there .
i 'm gettin ' there
look up , sunshine
i thought you could use it . when you start your band .
enough !
we 're your guys .
no - i 've got a sweet-payin ' job that i 'm about to lose .
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country .
pirate -- no question .
but -- who -- what -- ?
we 'll all go crazy ...
blind faith is what i consider heresy !
if-god-wills-it !
i find that hard to believe .
i am busy inside .
i can 't keep my eyes off you . i would like to catch up with all the moments i didn 't spend with you .
yes ... yes , i do ... on all of them !
this time with me !
not bad .
call them .
look out of that window .
you did the same to your god !
to open a new route to asia . at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it ...
colon ! don 't !
you 'll always be older than me , father .
surely you can do anything you want .
thirty seven , your majesty ... and you ?
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you 'll do as i say .
my horse doesn 't work .
you did not hear me , don colon . not my horse .
god be with us admiral .
immediately .
yes , your majesty .
never , your majesty . although ...
i don 't think it 's abuse , i think it 's torture .
somewhere else ?
i came to see how the investigation was going . i called and you 're not here . i wait up at the station and you don 't even show up ! ! ! i beep you - you don 't return my call . where the hell have you been ? !
okay . but not water sports .
what 's the kid gon na say - sorry ? meanwhile i 'm not here anymore . like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan . six hours ago this guy was walkin ' his dog or buyin ' a quart of milk . who knows ? but some kid 's robbed him for $ 3 or some shit and shot him and now you can 't tell if he 's a piece of beef or a human being and i 'm thinkin ' that 's me . sooner or later . that 's me .
i know . relax . take it easy . don 't worry , we 'll get those fuckers .
i 'm on my way with eddie . ludwig 's . 63rd and madison . the suspects might be there already .
raw deal .
i can 't talk right now . we have some things to take care of .
again ? i didn 't wan na do it the first time .
yes sir .
i want to document my trip to america .
don 't want to film this ?
cut !
the one who got caught in the bathroom . george michael .
be quiet . watch .
this footage will work in your favor . when the jury sees this - no matter what cutler tries , they 'll convict him .
okay . you 're a czech national and you 're a russian national . how do you know one another ?
hey . c'mon , you can 't leave me like this . some freak 'll come by and stab me !
but you knew that , right ?
i 'm fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?
well , that does sound very odd .
thank you . it 's been a great pleasure to meet all of you ... dr. smyslov .
i 'm terribly sorry . i was just on my way down to meet you . i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time , and i was on my way out of the office when , suddenly , the phone rang .
i 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement .
tomb , shine , survey-marker spare part , take your choice .
roger .
it looks like we have another bad a.o . unit . my fpc shows another impending failure .
look , give me a break , you 're going to have to settle for her place . it 's the only thing i know .
try obeyin ' the law once in awhile , and i won 't have to hassle you ...
you got a real big mouth , convict .
he 's just kiddin ' , you just keep doin ' what i tell ya , you 'll be okay .
here 's hoping , baby ...
don 't give me that police shit . you drop it .
what are you talking about ? we didn 't kill her ...
not likely , reggie . maybe i just need some help .
what are you talkin ' about ? this suit 's mine . it cost $ 900 .
listen , it may be a little out of date . you know , i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies ...
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut .
mission district . gon na find us an indian .
last night , two nights ago , three ?
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you ... tell me a little about her . she got great tits ?
my kind of place . i always liked country boys .
some of us citizens are with you all the way , officer .
while you 're at it , you can give me the switchblade , too .
who gives a goddamn what you think ? you 're just a crook that 's got a weekendpass ... you 're not even a name anymore . just a spear- chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues ...
if he 's hoping that then he 's dumber than i think he is , which would be amazin ' , cause i already think he 's real dumb .
right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you 're all set .
yeah . it missed the last four stops .
don 't worry about it .
if she 's right , and if you don 't screw up .
jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian ... in other words , we can 't seen like we 're in the revenge business ... i know , we all know the truth 's a little different .
i 'm taking my prisoner back to jail .
hey ... dick tracy .
okay . see you in the morning ... you know , you ought to get some rest ...
i 'm not paid to take your personal calls . he was in some bar . .. off duty .
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back .
jack ? what was that ?
shut up .
you try to mess with us or go to the cops , i promise you , i 'll put holes in her you wouldn 't believe .
i 'll got your money to you . no sweat .
i know ...
weddings are one floor down . congratulations .
theoretically , yes ! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there , but ... i don 't have the reference book . i 've never seen the stones work !
yes..thank god..
this is government business now . you ought to go home and get some rest , father .
the supreme being , the fifth element is here , in our parish ! ! ! it 's a miracle ! ! !
absolutely sure there 's the triple suns on her gloves !
later , david ! later ! there 's not a minute to lose !
they are ... with me ...
vito cornelius ?
we will be ready , lord .
yes ma..
... and now you 're making fun of me ? i 'm warning you ! if you don 't take me after all these years of sacrifice , i 'll never forgive you ! !
not without leeloo .
i 'll be right back .
it 's like a cab isn 't it ?
fuck it ! hold tight !
dear listeners , your favorite dj is alive and kicking . it 's seven o'clock and time for the news . tune in tomorrow for another adventure .
the words you 're looking for weren 't in the dictionary you studied . i won 't be long .
don 't worry , sir . i have the perfect one .
how much time is left ?
i can hear you , mr. president , but i can 't see you .
i 'm about to , mr. president .
then let us toast to your fame ! here billy..
... i can 't wait to be among you .
i just talked to her .
what can i do for you today ?
i remember him .
well , that 's all i can do . sorry .
fuck you .
catchy title . what are you really reading ? hard to believe that book 's got any parts worth highlighting .
thomas welles . nice picture .
what kind of junior p.i . would i be if i didn 't go with you ?
it 's not my money . the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought . let 's not make a big deal out of this , okay ? go be a race car driver . go run for president . whatever .
i try to be .
thank you .
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat . drinking whiskey , chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses . want to know what it 's really like ? it 's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight , pissing in a plastic bottle , pardon me , because some guy thinks his wife 's cheating on him . glamorous , huh ? and the guy who hired you , he has a hair-lip , dandruff and crooked teeth , and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife 's cheating , and you don 't blame her .
of course .
i 'm trying to find out . she was a runaway . i 'm looking into it for her parents .
i haven 't slept much either . since kristen ...
you could do worse .
it was no suicide . it was not an accident . it was freddy , and he 's coming back for seconds , thirds , and fourths .
the story is , the deaths you can 't argue with .
three days .
it 's okay , we 're just about there .
you know , i get the weirdest feeling we 've been through this before .
give her time . beauty is skin deep .
she knew she was gon na die .
what i what ? well , i 've thought about it . i plan to keep him .
what are you talking about ? my `` condition '' ? ...
been having bad dreams .
no ...
my friend , with the funny hand .
daddy , he 's coming back ... krueger 's coming back . make them understand .
when dan died you weren 't even asleep . you said so . end of story .
no accident . i tried to warn all of you about krueger .
i think krueger 's trying to do something to it .
i just can 't figure out how he 's getting in when i 'm awake ...
if they actually bothered to bury her .
we 've got to go to the asylum and find her body . mark said her soul 's trapped with it -- that 's why she can 't come to me . it must be !
so did dan .
that 's okay . he 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep .
i think i 'm starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
greta , come on . one burger with me ?
well we got ta do something !
that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead .
i 'm very fucking sorry , but greta is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?
nobody thinks that .
why don 't i go make some coffee . there 's a lot to tell .
i don 't believe this ... all that gore you paint in the comics and you 're squeamish ?
makes you look like a nun --
i want to talk about the baby .
your father can be in nome , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices : ask them to send him out in a 'copter ' , and take you off , or the shark can put back into nome ...
oh it does ? ? ?
radiation level ... constantly rising ...
what direction does the system indicate ?
after torpedo room : report !
take a look .
nothing we can do , now .
minus three .
come where ?
thank you .
i 'll be another !
toward the pole !
all right - go to it .
same old shit .
shit .
the truck 's here . looks like they 've stayed inside since the snow started .
how 's that ?
it 's called a grilled cheese sandwich , you dub .
come on , smart guy . tell how it 's no big deal . tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman 's head .
you think you can take me now ? come on , try .
what about jill ? is lillian bringing her ?
that 's the way of the world , little one . didn 't they teach you that in school ?
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality .
it 's okay , honey . i got you . i got you . you 're okay .
warn then again . if they don 't respond ... shoot them down . we will not be intimidated .
copy air force one . welcome to the party .
i 'm doing what i can .
that kid 's name was jim marshall .
this doesn 't make sense .
an exercise in futility . send the nimitz back in .
does your office have anything to add , mr. dean ?
to swear you in as president .
roger .
romeo tango zulu , copy one the television , graphics of the first family against the presidential seal .
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you . now if you 're all cleared ? you can follow me then .
very good . thank you , ms. mitchell .
come on , alice .
you will be the first to pay for that mistake .
you 're very valuable . and our nation needs so many things .
call up petrov and order stravanavitch ' s release .
pity . mr. gibbs .
you don 't like seeing people get hurt . now in morality , that is a virtue . in politics , however , that is weakness . you were a hostage to everyone else * long before you were a hostage to
one thing i 've learned as
hold on , alice .
yes , sir .
that isn 't necessary .
rose , i don 't have time for this .
please ... don 't start with me .
both of you .
actually , sir , you could be that someone .
we 'll just say it was in bad taste .
okay . hey , pumpkin , you 'll tell me all about it later , right ?
i never left . where 's my wife and daughter ?
a mig ? where the hell are we ?
iraq ? shep , you 're fired .
they better . fuel 's almost gone .
forget it . the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule .
you better check it , unger .
you better check on it , mr. dunn . i 'll stay here and fly the ship .
ted , i loved you and i 'll always love you . but i need simon . he 's stable . he 's a good provider . i want that at this stage of the game , ted . he might have his faults , but simon doesn 't know the meaning of the word fear and i need that in a man .
i have to get in there . i have to stop this flight .
let me by , elaine .
i 've got it , elaine ! i 've figured out what 's wrong with the shuttle !
the human brain is a highly complex organ , elaine , perhaps the most complex next to the bladder . let me show you . ted 's problem is in this area . this area , this area , here , here , here , under here , here ...
roger .
we 'll have to check , jimmy . it 's a pretty long trip to mercury .
have you tried it with a little cinnamon ?
captain oveur , your navigator , mr. unger , and your first officer , mr. dunn .
yes , sir , commander . this is mercury one . everything seems a- okay up here and ready for count-down .
that 's right , striker . and we 're getting married when we return .
well , we laughed . we laughed all the time .
that 's very nice of you . thank you .
chicago , the passengers are beginning to panic . when do we start down ?
i can 't tell .
i 'm not sure . i haven 't seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival .
extremely serious . it starts with a slight fever .
i think you ought to know what our chances are . the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing : finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane , but who didn 't have fish for dinner .
be patient , ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately .
that 's what i 've been trying to tell these people .
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
i don 't care . i just don 't have what it takes . they 'd be better off with someone who 'd never flown before .
joey can stay up here for a while if he 'd like to .
who wants to be first ?
you are now eight miles from the airport . turn right to a heading of zero eight niner , throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet .
all right , he 's on final now ! put out all runway lights except niner .
well , it wasn 't all that i had hoped .
what is it ?
i will , but jim won 't .
no , why don 't you take care ot it ?
all right . but just remember , my name is roger murdock .
thank you .
oh -- i haven 't flown for a long time .
no . no thank you .
thank you , randy . you better leave sweetheart . you might get hurt in here .
no , sergeant -- not history ... eternity ...
stay back ! i 'm okay .
when will strader return ?
through his ass . next time you see him , tell him to call me ... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes .
my wife ? she worries about me .
a man , a human , was wiring it to your car . i didn 't get a good look at him . i must call my wife ...
stay out of this , matthew . tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall .
it 'd be for your own good . i think you 'd be better off with a partner who 's a little more ... by the book . ... still , i got ta tell you , george , for a quiet guy , you 're sure hell on wheels once you get going . i 'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective .
there ! go back . down that side street .
do what ? ! george -- ? !
sure . just a minute .
come on . you got nothin ' better to do , cushy county job like yours .
you mean the blob ? they 're finishing up now .
it is .
whatever gave you that idea ?
i got him . don 't get pinned .
let 's go ... let 's go . cycle through !
rescue mission . there 's some juicy colonists ' daughters we got ta rescue from virginity .
awright . fire-team a . gear up . let 's move . two minutes . somebody wake up hicks .
awright ! i want a nice clean dispersal this time .
let 's go . pull 'em out .
i 'm afraid so . the crash did too much damage . the overload is inevitable , at this point .
see you soon .
well , i was going to wait until after the inquest ...
well , the corporation co-financed that colony with the colonial administration , against mineral rights . we 're getting into a lot of terraforming ... 'building better worlds . '
well , it didn 't occur to me . it 's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board .
i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you .
it 's insured .
thirty-eight ... simulated .
the structure seems intact . they have power .
gorman ! give it a rest would you .
shut up . just shut up !
they 're but off ! do something !
how do i get out of this chicken-shit outfit ?
okay , stand by in operations . let 's go .
you tell me . i only work here .
not that tunnel , the other one !
six meters . five . what the fu --
fuckin ' a !
about seventeen days .
on my way .
but they don 't know that . they 're probably looking for other ways to get in . that 'll take them awhile .
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back . then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked .
all right ! she 's alive . i believe it . but we got ta get moving ! now !
we ain 't going anywhere .
no . have you ?
maybe you haven 't been keeping up on current events , but we just got out asses kicked , pal !
yeah , right , it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here .
they 're right on us . vasquez , how you doing ?
no.. i 've slept enough .
what about me ?
i don 't want to ... i have scary dreams .
why do they tell little kids that ?
did one of those things grow inside her ?
i know , honey . me too .
newt , wait !
certainly !
perhaps .
why ?
don 't keep calling me that . it puts me at such a distance . i was not born a court composer , you know . i 'm from a small town , just like your husband .
ah . well . ah , i see you 've got your manager with you . well , madame , how about half the receipts ?
finally ! such an immense joy . diletto straordinario !
your highness .
i 'm thinking about herr mozart . what is your view ?
it 's actually quite amusing , majesty . it 's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a -
enchanted , madame .
well - well we haven 't quite received my father 's consent , your majesty . not entirely . not altogether .
thank you , sire !
in my opinion , it is time we had a piece in our own language , sir . plain german . for plain people .
oh , yes . oh , i mean no - not exactly like this . i mean today - just today , stanzi - i remember now . she had to go - yes ! she had to help her mother . yes , she 's like that . her mother 's a very sweet woman , you 'll see .
but my penalty . i 've got to have a penalty .
mine ?
i never saw this girl in my life . is this a kind of joke ?
bene .
yes what ?
papa , the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room .
well , i 'm a good teacher . the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs , please let me know . goodbye , fraulein , goodbye , madame ! goodbye , sir !
but this is absurd !
work fast . and be sure to tell no one what you do . you will see me again soon .
just let me tell you how it begins .
taking out what you should never have put in .
oh yes , certainly . certainly , herr director !
oh , german ! german ! please let it be german .
baron !
i 'm surprised you don 't know . it was a very popular tune in its day . i wrote it . how about this ?
show her in . then go to bed .
miss gallagher , surely you must perform some function here at the hospital .
come to my office , miss price .
no . he knows no one in london , besides me . i shouldn 't have left him alone .
will you give me a break ?
it 's nice to see you .
see you later .
i 'm freezing .
rational ! ? ! i 'm a fucking werewolf , for christ 's sake !
will you shut up ! ? ! !
you did , did you ?
quiet , everyone ! hush ! shhh !
you could have told them !
i was having a nightmare .
get your fucking hands off me ! what the hell is going on here ?
sure , as a kid . but never so real . never so bizarre .
of course not , david . i 'll fetch in young miss price .
what do you mean ? i 'm starving .
apparently so .
yeah .
do you think it 's a dog ?
a sheep dog or something . turn slowly and let 's walk away .
are you going to help me up ?
well , then , what can i do for scotland yard ?
stay here . if we need you , we 'll know where to reach you .
no .
take it easy , clark .
not at all . that 's alexander hamilton 's idea [ 5 ] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known . those are his exact words , gentlemen . character ! it 's the only thing you can bank on , and it 's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums .
i can 't ? you just wait and see . if that run doesn 't stop within the next hour , i 'll shut the doors . you know what that means ? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow . you 'll be forced to liquidate . i 'll insist upon it . the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar . what 's left you gentlemen can have . but i 'll guarantee there won 't be enough to pay your next month 's garage bill .
the bank . all right . do anything you want with it .
all right , jack , all right .
they took my keys yesterday . i went there to get them back .
why , i needed a
oh , yeah ?
oh no , mr. cluett , if it 's all the same to you , i 'd rather not wait . it 's about you and mrs. dickson .
of course , let them in ! you 're late now .
well , that 's too bad . mine 's all right too .
hello , darling .
yes , sir .
numbers ? no , never mind .
yes , sir .
and what 's more , keep up the good work and who knows - some day you 'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . . not a bad thought , eh ?
there you are .
listen , matt . if you don 't tell the truth , i can 't help you . where were you last night ?
no wonder he didn 't want to mention her name .
here 's the data on the clyde deal .
what are you talking about ?
oh , is that so ?
yeah .
i tell you , i saw them !
all right , dear .
sure i do . he has the best room in me house . the one with the fancy wallpaper .
they 're starting to come in already . yeah . yeah . well , listen . don 't waste any time . get all the money you can lay your hands on , and bring it down here right away . step on it .
tom , i 'm this close to coming with you ...
dammit , this stopped being fun about two years ago !
anywhere nobody 's shooting at me is pretty .
that was two hours ago .
better pass them over here before something happens to 'em .
frankly , yes . i 'm feeling a little left out .
... will perry ...
two .
exactly .
one false move and i 'll blow your heads off !
yes . i am obviously not standing out in people 's minds at the robberies .
no , really . you 're wife said she needed some help , seeing as you were so fat you couldn 't find your --
what 's going on ?
planting corn . harvesting corn . year after year .
she got two of them .
just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn 't make him smart .
hold on , hold on , we all know bob is an important part of the gang .
what will be ?
and i 'm the better outlaw .
you 'll be smiling once you 've got all that money to spend , cousin . cole younger 's going to make everybody rich !
clell , tom , go get doc mimms in liberty !
pass me some whisky .
we didn 't . zerelda did . turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw .
you pay me to find you bluecoats . there they are .
sadie was not a man !
get buckets !
me get heap firewater --
go on . you 're pretty much all healed up .
zerelda , it 's no coincidence . the railroad men come through , offering to buy up land . nobody sells . then they start hanging men who own farms for treason ?
the bullet came out clean , but he lost a whole lot of blood . praying wouldn 't hurt .
i 'm upset too , zee , but jesse and cole know what they 're doing . i 'm sure they won 't press their luck .
we better go to doc 's , see what 's going on here .
saved all our lives , doc . none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms , doc . god 's honest truth .
what worries me is that jesus is talking back .
your zee ? hmm . `` from women 's eyes this doctrine i derive : they sparkle still the right promethean fire ; they are the books , the arts , the academes , that show , contain , and nourish all the world . ''
shut up . uh , doc , i was wondering if , uh , this evening , i could come by ?
ma .
and that 's why you both lead the gang . two of you went into that bank together , right ?
and i do so want to shoot some pinkerton detectives .
no , i --
got any ideas , little brother ?
he 's a good christian and he killed yankees . jesus told me that made him an all right boy .
nuh-huh ...
frank and me have to go away for a while .
not that day . i am guilty of many things , but that was mr. thaddeus rains and parker , that day .
pity .
he 's too important , james . they 'll set the army on you . you and your wife .
you don 't think god 'll mind , do you ?
tonight ? why , i 'm just getting ready to turn on the younger charm .
it 's his money . he 's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune . you do want to hurt thaddeus rains , don 't you jesse ?
i 'm doing you folks a favor --
move you fools !
i look forward to seeing it .
vengeance .
turn the light on .
maybe .
alright .
it 's not that nice .
nice .
i know her . i knew her .
face it-the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s .
it looks that way , doesn 't it ?
new card . what do you think ?
but wait . you ain 't seen nothin ' yet .
impressive . very nice . let 's see paul owen 's card .
i 'm just a happy camper . rockin ' and a-rollin ' . van patten rehab 's done wonders for you , pal . working for unicef now ?
your friend has already been seated . follow me , mr. halberstam .
patrick , i think he knows you 're here . it 's only ten-thirty .
well , i 'd like to travel . and maybe go back to school , but i really don 't know ... i 'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities , but i 'm so ... i don 't know ... unsure .
i know i should go . i know i have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men , and ... i mean , do you want me to go ?
well , most guys i know who work in mergers and acquisitions don 't really like it .
hello
if you had an american express card she 'd give you a blowjob . listen , this girl worked in a tanning salon , need i say more ? ... what do you do ?
well ...
dan , great to see you again . like i said , you need anything at all , i 'm your man . i don 't envy your job . i mean owen was a ... complex man .
i 'm so hungry .
i 've been great . and you ?
they 're okay . bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste . but then sports came out in 1983 , i think they really came into their own , commercially and artistically .
prob'ly waiting by the phone for outpost to call . we 'll leave it for him ?
we 're not gon na let it .
milo ! what about -- ?
okay , yeah . i did something naughty ... there 's this amazing comix store in seattle . to tell you the truth , i did it once or twice at stanford . 'guess i can 't keep anything from you ...
i went to see the skywire model in gary 's office . you know . just to hold it again .
i am . i am , sir .
'forgot to introduce you . i have a girlfriend .
gim me the coordinates ?
there 's a rumor going around , maybe you 've heard it .
okay . i 'm gary .
definitely .
34,000 . but they 're real short lines . 'just came out that way .
nothing does . still . i want him to like me .
in exchange for endowments . they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em .
cool .
let 's get him in here .
i launched skywire . just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to gary 's satellite .
no . please .
she saved my life .
there 're so many disinformation sites about gary already . where he has devil 's horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein .
oh . i liked you . i was checking you out .
'cause their apartments might be bugged ?
tell me you 're not calling on your car phone ? !
hey , we got seed money for the startup ! a million-five !
what ? !
oh we 're not going to the campus .
mmmm ... i feel extreme relaxation .
my god , vanessa 's got a smashing body . i bet she shags like a minx . how do i tell them that because of the unfreezing process , i have no inner monologue ? i hope i didn 't say that out loud just now .
that 's not your mother , that 's a man !
don 't try to suck up to me ! it 's a little late for that . i 'm a freak ! look at it , it 's been rendered useless .
oh forget it . as a fellow player on the international stage , mr . powers , i 'm sure you 'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act .
no , mr . powers , i expect them to die . even after they pay me the money , i 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma . all right , guard , begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism .
yes , we 've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone , an on-board computer , and a global geosynchronous positioning device . oh , and finally , this .
oh , i forgot to tell you , they 're prescription x-ray glasses . i have very bad astigmatism .
that cat number two has an x-ray eyepatch . i get bad vibes from him , man . listen , we should go back to the room , but first i have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog .
do you want to talk to him ?
let me see .
you 're crazy . the camera loves you , vanessa .
no , this is me in a nutshell .
don 't worry , baby . i picked up a mind control technique during my travels to india . i learned it from my guru , the late guru shastri , a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis . just watch me . watch me , now .
yes , act naturally and we 'll split this scene the way we came in , vanessa .
hey , wait a minute --
here , have a piece of gum .
hey ! wait a minute , that 's my last piece of gum .
that 's a direct order . you didn 't see a thing !
ya wohl -- i mean , yes wohl , herr doctor . i have created the ultimate weapon to defeat austin powers . bring on the fembots !
don 't be so hard on yourself . you 're here , that 's what 's important . a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step .
not me .
right . oh , hell , let 's just do what we always do . let 's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage . gentlemen , it 's come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days . here 's the plan . we get the warhead , and we hold the world ransom ... ... for one million dollars !
oh , really ? one-hundred billion dollars . ok , make it happen . anything else ?
i know . let me just say this : austin was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had .
i don 't know . i was thinking , maybe i 'd be a vet or something , cause i like animals and stuff .
three days .
ah , but you haven 't see the real me . watch closely ...
you don 't get rain like you used to in england . a good shower that 's the ticket . stiffens resolve , puckers the spirit , quells the namby-pamby in a man .
out in india . so character-forming for the british . not the heat . good lord , no . the rain , dash it . a good monsoon . fifteen inches overnight . a whole week of lovely rain . i remember one summer in jaipur ...
eh ? in here !
we have met ...
let me guess -- 'father ' ?
ropes ?
directed by laser . bounced by satellite . quite possible .
next assignment ?
thank you , steed .
thanks , valentine ...
we 're not here to talk about the weather , surely .
a kipper . or a red herring ? what were they investigating ?
ahh . perfect fit . the luxury of a hand-made shoe . as unique as a face or a fingerprint . or should i say dna ?
thank you , trubshaw ...
do you really think so ?
small talk . try the weather .
did you say formal ? i must dress .
how on earth can you tell ?
have i trespassed on a male prerogative ? we 're being followed . i saw him at trubshaw 's ...
have we been invited ?
'the merry widow ? ' i might have known . where 's the reception ?
have a look at this .
must be . trubshaw 's busy . i 'll send mother ...
i 'm no spy -- where do i fit in ?
so you say ...
brenda and i thought we 'd drop in .
no . her husband , she says . alice tried to warn us . a trap . tell mother beware . tell father that 's all .
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation . on the day he died , he was setting a test . to prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion . he had to be certain . he said he was going to give mrs. peel something ...
i think so , thank you so much ...
ugh ...
check out the other guy 's buns .
i feel like i 'm spying on rick .
right in here . the big show starts in one minute .
too bad , man , that blows my chance to be ambassador to france .

what do you know , they moved it . catch you later .
your attention , please . may i be the first to say , it 's a raid !
no . let 's at least finish the set .
you can tell a man by his friends .
this isn 't right .
so long , father .
take care .
and here 's mike 's partner , in more ways than one . a gal who doesn 't think happiness ends with primates . the very lovely , miss desiree ...
okay , rick , all finished . i can 't wait for that bachelor party ... i need the action .
yeah . who 'd have thought they 'd both be a size 138 regular .
be gentle .

you ain 't happy about the green light ?
look at my lips .

you 'll both get an advance and you can stay with me .
well do something about it .
c.p . time is colored people 's time . the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late . that negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance .
it 's right and tight . good morning , let me introduce you to everybody . you know my assistant , sloan .
derrick coleman , he possessed all the talent in the world , coulda , shoulda , been a great ballplayer but alas d.c. didn 't want it bad enough . delacroix , do you want it ? bad enough to kill for it ? do you want it that much .
dunwitty , don 't leave .
the same old , same old . trying to get my stuff through .
baby , you treat me so good . peerless , you 're a good son , i love you . you never gave me no trouble .
always keep 'em laughing .
is that so ?
your father is proud of you .
break a leg .
i 'm sorry , i can 't help it . it 's too funny .
everybody shut up .
a small victory isn 't that small when you 've been use to losing .
i didn 't think this was in your studies at nyu .
give me the gun .
thank you very much . i always try my best .
the best defense is offense .
and this is my very best friend mantan .
a song a comin ' i feel .
well , homeboy , looks like he 's at a funeral .
for what ? he left . not me .
my people love me .
it was my joke . i was tired , and did not care to go farther . there 's not prettier woman here than that . if she won 't suit your fancy , my friend , then you must wait awhile .
i am not sure . the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money , he would have to fight for it .
not yet , but i believe he intends to .
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that ?
i will let down the steps for your honor .
yes , sir . here is my letter .
with a woman who is completely charming , be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition , and who , regardless of her rank , will show me some kindness , tonight .
old fool !
all right , five hundred guineas .
the prince left him only that choice .
when is he to go ?
what is to be done ?
oh , i am grateful to you , sir . i am the wife of captain o'reilly hastening to join him at dublin . my chair was stopped by a highwayman ; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees , armed as he was , and though there were thirty people in the next field , working , when the ruffian attacked , not one of them would help but , on the contrary , wished him `` good luck . ''
yeah , and i could 've used the sleep . i 'm supposed to meet people here tonight , try and get some work going .
i 'm -- i 'm sorry ...
fine .
maybe he 's dead too . maybe you killed them both , mueller --
can anybody hear me !
we found him like this ! kendall was with me the whole -- listen to me !
shut up , mueller .
what do you mean , alone ?
we found him like this ...
yeah . and that 's all i 'm saying .
jesus !
no , ma'am , he just wanted us to quit . making it through was kind of an honor . some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight , command would consider you at the top of the class .
would you have believed me ?
your weapons , sergeant .
so did we . why didn 't you come ?
west 's . any kindling for afire ?
i mean i killed him . isn 't that what we all wanted ?
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place . it 's gettin ' bad out there -- where 's west ?
do i ?
becoming a morphine addict during basic ain 't exactly something you want to broadcast . only mueller and childs know .
put it down !
i honestly don 't know . maybe to have someone to cover for him . and i wish i could , but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men .
stop .
then we 'll leave it up to the courts -- his word against mine . what does his father do again ? steelworker ? doesn 't matter , i 'm sure justice will be served . in any case , my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions , these accusations on his son . he 's quite protective .
i didn 't do anything --
jag gets here in three hours . try for the confession .
i wouldn 't know where to start . i guess it was about one man framing another . he thought if the other guy got blamed , people would over look his own wrong doings .
the senator ...
see , ray , this is what we call `` good cop , bad cop '' . she shouts , i stand up for you , you 're grateful , a bond of trust is established .
i lied . wait for it ...
i don 't know .
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by . it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass , and you know what ? he deserved it . there 's your confession .
what happened next ?
good idea .
right back where we started .
isn 't this how your story goes ?
yeah . i can wait till you 're off the base and do it myself .
oh , yeah , `` excuse me , sergeant , sir , we don 't feel like going out -- we don 't want to get rained on . '' he 'll kick our asses from here to cleveland .
toughens us up , pike . you don 't like it , quit .
what the fuck happened to you ? one minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas --
blame the nigger , then , huh ? someone turns up dead , you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
shut the fuck up . he was gon na cut him loose .
we 're not going anywhere .
he tried to burn dunbar to us . you don 't do that if you 're not involved .
the army kicked you out for drugs ...
it was on that night karl met his destiny . and i met mine . almost .
that 's great .
edward bloom .
it truly is .
i don 't expect to .
i suspect it will hurt a lot .
i promise . someday . when i 'm really supposed to .
i was 18 . he was 28 . turns out that was a big difference .
i see . i thank you for your time .
i can get it . i can just ...
well , we were all set to , but there was a complication .
truth is , i 've been thirsty my whole life . never really known why .
that poet , norther winslow did . he was going to paris , france . he must have liked it , because no one ever heard from him again . tell you what . you take the other way and i 'll cut through here . meet you on the far side .
just to be sure , you can take my pack .
i said this isn 't how i go . the last part is much more unusual . trust me on that .
oh , so you know .
yes .
i think someone hasn 't .
somehow , you 're better . different . you 're getting ready to go . and i say ...
i have the rest of my life to find out .
go out with me .
i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas .

you 're right . you 're right .
oh , shit . that was scary . in the middle of the robbery . the manager looks at me . right in the eye . and goes , i 'm going to remember you .
even if it 's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not ?
no . we didn 't .
sure .
no , no . look . ok. let 's stay here until we find out what 's going on .
don 't worry about it , bob .
yes ... it 's true .

easy , dignan . it 's ok .
hopefully this trip 'll go a little smoother than the last one .
did that hurt ?
it was bob . his walkie talkie 's busted .
i don 't think so .
what can i say ? it 's jail . you don 't sleep when you want to . you don 't eat when you want to .
it 's called a racquet , anthony , and you 're holding it wrong . that 's ghetto play . hold it like this .
yeah . convert it into lofts . ok . pop quiz . what 's the single most important aspect of your job ?
yeah . i 've stolen two cars before . one jaguar . and one trans-am . with t- tops . that trans-am was fun to drive .
pot is an herb . it 's just like any type of gardening .
what was that ?
he looked too shaken-up .
i don 't know . i don 't know anything . except phil says they got him . and he 's in jail .
it was stupid .
cause you would of let my brother rot in jail .
god , yes . like silk .
we 're going too slow . it looks like we 're following him .
i don 't know , bob . what about one of those ?
good question .
let 's just go .
no . i was calm .
no . all he 'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose .
i don 't want to talk about it .
he wouldn 't move .
that 's right . i only have one vote . we 'll go talk with anthony and figure it out .
let 's go .
yeah . it is .
i didn 't have any choice .
yeah . hey , clay .
good to know you , john .
the sooner the better .
i speak english .
she wouldn 't let me . she 's the only reason you 're alive .
they know ! they know you were here . they know you killed these two guys . they know you and conklin had something on the side . they don 't know what it is , but they know !
conklin ! stuff on conklin !
alexanderplatz . 30 minutes . under the world clock . alone . give her your phone .
i 'm working on it .
-- uplink all relevant files to kim -- -- and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone --
-- the hotel -- how far ? --
i want to look at the room . check it out .
but we can relax . we tracked him . he 's on a train to moscow .
is there . is all there .
i think that bourne and conklin were in business . that bourne is still involved . and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin , it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever he 's been hiding to kill again . how 's that scan ?
i hear . this wallace is a bandit , nothing more .
so the scots will have none of them , will they ? my armorers have already made a thousand .
you let wallace escape your whole army . you can not blame me for this .
before he lost his powers of speech , he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead .
hamish , i ... thank ...
fourteen ? --
mornay has come . so will the bruce .
we 're here to stay . we don 't care to live , if we can 't fight beside ya .
no . one of us is enough .
a magistrate wished to capture him , and found he had a secret lover , so he cut the girl 's throat to tempt wallace to fight -- and fight he did .
wife of edward , the king 's son ?
she was my wife . we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord . they killed her to get to me . and she was pregnant .
i have taken vows . more than one . i 've vowed faithfulness to my husband , and sworn to give him a son . and i can not keep both promises .
every man dies . not every man really lives .
no english lord would trust an irishman !
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field .
aye . but it won 't let me dream .
i 'm sorry , but can it wait til tonight ? i 'm already late for work --
nine , ten . and you 're awake ! open your eyes , dammit !
so what did you find .
the hemorrhaging ... the neural damage is irreparable . i 'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions .
great . i 'll see you soon .
he 's saying it 's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year . overload city . 'sat about the gist of it , doc ?
come on , mom . just 'cause dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn 't mean that i 'm nuts .
you told me that on parents ' weekend . remember ? wait , that wasn 't me . or you .
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories .
sorry , dude . just figured it 'd be okay with you bein ' sick and all .
shit , lenny . what 's happened to you ! we 've got ta get help !
you really don 't remember anything that happened ?
he must be . they 're letting him go , right ?
hi , lenny .
mmmm ... you give good compliment . clean up and come back to bed .
those are your clothes , silly .
you 'll see .
go on . sit down .
simple math . when i woke up this morning and saw your smile ... i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you .
what ?
he 's a fucking maniac !
that 's right , evan , and you get to be the star .
calm down , kid . stand still .
been there , done that .
i won 't let you down , professor carter .
maybe because they never do . so don juan , you pass out on all your dates ?
sure . i was gon na make a new one , anyway .
gee , thanks friend .
forget it . what 's the point of psych now ? tomorrow i could wake up as some dirt farmer in bangladesh .
my mom packed for me . i think she sent everything i ever owned . so we 'll see .
fat little baby , crying for mommy .
hold your horses , man . it 's here somewhere . i saw it when i was a kid .
what happened ? ? where are we ? !
what 's wrong with you ? !
get this `` us '' shit . as if i was gon na lay a hand on my own sister . you 've done nicely for yourself , evan . nice friends , nice life , not to mention you 're fucking my sister . not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself .
i 'll do whatever you want . you don 't want me to ever see kayleigh again , fine . just let crockett go . besides , you kill him now and they 'll stick you in juvy for sure . and i know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father .
i think i 'll go check out the chapel .
yeah , you do that , lenny .
no .
i 'm sorry . it is .
yes , sir .
you 're a fat hypocrite . you don 't feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do .
it 's certainly not good enough . but since i 'm in a hurry , it 'll have to do .
i shall remember to pay it ... to myself .
not for sure , monsieur , but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick .
it 's the gestapo . they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow .
ah , that 's the new german 77 . and judging by the sound , only about thirty-five miles away .
i know very little about you , just the fact that you had your teeth straightened .
if we would walk out so soon , it would only call attention to us . perhaps ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe .
and as far away from major strasser as possible .
to tell you the truth , i am frightened too . shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall i carry on the best i can ?
-- this is mr. laszlo .
you 're saying this only to make me go .
not at all .
oh , save it . we 've still lots of things to do .
this is a very interesting cafe . i congratulate you .
well , perhaps i shall like it in casablanca .
i was in a german concentration camp for a year . that 's honor enough for a lifetime .
if i didn 't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more `` persuasive methods '' at your disposal , i certainly won 't give them to you now .
how do you do , mr. rick ?
i admit he is very clever . three times he slipped through our fingers . in paris he continued his activities . we intend not to let it happen again .
perhaps .
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here .
victor laszlo is on that plane .
ask monsieur rick .
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich .
i was born in new york city if that 'll help you any .
-- thanks . i will .
another precedent gone . this has been a very interesting evening . i 'll call you a cab . gasoline rationing , time of night .
who knows ? in her own way she may constitute an entire second front . i think it 's time for me to flatter major strasser a little . i 'll see you later , rick .
i am shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !
stay where you are . i don 't know what you 're talking about .
-- sacha , call a cab .
take your hands off me !
i was willing to shoot captain renault , and i 'm willing to shoot you .
hello ugarte .
no , mr. richard . i can 't find her .
survive today , that 's the point .
i 'm putting it off .
you idiot , if he dives , he 'll capsize the raft .
i 'm dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel . with kelly .
there was an unavoidable delay .
he was a sorry sonofabitch , and i 'm sorry i ever married him .
you smell like formaldehyde .
let 's take a look .
chuck , forget the xerox . so russia didn 't turn out well ?
for when i travel ?
hey ... hey ... it 's okay !
a few things came up . or went down .
my epitaph .
under the circumstances your overall health is good . those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated , but they 're healing nicely .
no .
so did i .
it 's nothing you did , mom , believe me .
there 's settled folks , and there 's nomads . you 're just not a settled folk . you never belonged here .
right . get me everything on indonesia , new guinea , all the way to australia .
want to see my raft ?
forty-three days .
i never thought it would end . then it did . it was so great to be saved , i couldn 't stop laughing .
deep , real deep .
try to think of nothing , dorothy .
life is waiting .
we all know who trained homer -- his credentials are as good as mine are . don 't you be holy to me about the *law* ! what has the law done for any of us here ?
i doubt it . she 's just an ...
i don 't know . she got left here , like the rest of us , didn 't she ?
good night , daddy .
daddy , *please* ...
sure ... i 'll see you around .
when i 'm not thinking about wally . i 'm not good at being alone . oh , goodness . you meant ... yes , i 'm fine . i ... ... i don 't suppose you 've seen a lobster yet .
`` king kong '' . it 's really good .
i *did* like it . all i said was , `` it 's not 'king kong ' . ''
you think ? maybe i was . i love this place !
did you come here with wally -- to *not* watch movies ?
nobody will swim here until next summer . by then , the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand -- there won 't be any sharp edges .
i 'm just waiting and seeing . like you said .
we 've got to keep her away from that bastard !
no , that 's not it -- i just want to be sure i understand you .
she knows how to take care of herself .
yes , i *have* !
well , this *is* an orphanage .
well , *picking* them is ! it 's about as exciting as ... walking !
i know what you 've been doing .
he *loved* it ! didn 't you ?
*homer* liked it ! didn 't you ?
how old are you , dear ? thirteen ?
well , we can only guess about that , edna . they *are* against the law .
but what about school records ? homer doesn 't have any *diplomas* ...
is that soon ?
why can 't we have pumpkins for christmas , too ? we don 't get any good presents at christmas , anyway .
it 's okay -- i don 't mind .
actually , someone did . i just didn 't think i could eat anything .
*and* over the himalayas . that 's called flying over the hump .
out back , there 's a shed . it 's just a mess . if that shed was better organized , i could put my truck in there .
homer , you the only one who 's read them rules , so you the only one who feels like he 's doin ' somethin ' wrong .
you forget yourself , homer . this here 's my daughter ! you got your own mess to deal with -- ain 't that right ?
mr. rose , i 'm in the *doctor* business . if you want , i can help you . you don 't have to go anywhere .
okay . then you can be of use .
that 's 'cause i sticked my *own* knife in the wound -- after she go , i sticked my *own* knife in there . i poked it all around , i just tryin ' to find the same place she got me .
i 'm not crazy about the `` little ... ''
we haven 't had a wilbur here in a year or so , have we ? we used to have *dozens* !
it is . i 'll get this . you go ahead .
how about this child ? you expect *her* to be responsible ?
it 's your heart -- you ought to take it with you .
right .
no trouble .
you think so , jack ? well ... i wouldn 't want to be in that wally 's shoes tonight .
anyway , i was just showing you this guy as an example of what 's available -- i didn 't think you 'd be interested .
they told muddy his feet was too flat !
we see you next harvest .
who *live* here in this cider house , peaches ? who grind them apples , who press that cider , who clean up the mess , and who just plain *live* here ... just breathin ' in the vinegar ? somebody who *don't* live here made them rules . them rules ain 't for *us* . *we* the ones who make up them rules . we makin ' our *own* rules , every day . ain 't that right , homer ?
that 's right -- that sounds like trouble to me .
you just stay out of trouble , homer !
you got ta let me go , daddy . please ...
i ain 't your business no more , daddy . please let me go .
that 's right , homer . this ain 't your business .
she 's about the most beautiful girl i ever seen -- i don 't know if she 's the nicest .
he ain 't never been outta maine !
oh god . i 'm overbearing and rude . lily . lily finn .
you 're welcome . i was just going to ask you if you 'd like to join us .
what do i do ? i 'm the vp of finance .
it 's alfonse . i want to settle up . i haven 't been ducking you . i told you i 'd get it .
suits used to say that in any con , sooner or later someone 's going to start asking the right questions . usually , it takes a little longer .
that was it . we had our crew . now we needed the mark .
you know when the first con was ever played ? it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden .
today ? started off great ...
alright , let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second . is this the best thing to do ?
it 's not like she 's a real redhead , jake ...
i just don 't know if this says , `` me '' . what 's the fabric ?
yes , her . where 's my wallet ?
we get fifty percent . and we get clear of the king .
so then miles walks straight into the creative director 's office and says `` the code 's fine , the program 's for shit '' and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk !
what ? no . use the bathroom on the plane !
you 're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything , are you ?
yeah well , sobo 's kid needs braces .
listen to me ! it went to shit . it happens sometimes .
help me .
we 're not cops .
gee thanks . now i don 't have to find that bridge to jump off .
don 't ruin this for me .
then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor , that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off . he said he was going to `` fuck some sense into me . ''
i don 't know . i packed up my shit and ran away . to this ... so unlike you , i guess i do have something to prove , in a repressed anger sort of way .
you know why i told you that , jake ? because i trust you too .
your friend , big al ? it should have been you .
it 's me . it 's jake . listen ... it 's happening . gordo 's landing right now . meet me at the euclid ... for your cut , i mean . it 's ... i want you to have it .
just mail it to the hospital . mr. king , please . it 's regarding an accounting problem . yes ... correct ... i know where it is . that will be fine . thank you .
wait a second ... who 's the mope ?
where the hell is she ?
there is no scam ! i 've got a fucking sign on my back ! i can 't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money . you get it ? it 's over . we walk .
jake ? customs ?
keep it up .
huh ? oh . she 's alright .
we got a good thing going here . you want to blow it over an overbite ?
i try .
literally . it 's not a bad deal , gentleman . i get peace of mind . you get detective sheilds . but this is the best part , walter ... walter , your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile . capice ?
what are you talking about ?
a couple i know are getting married .
south african women are very sporty .
you 've got such beautiful hands .
i thought you wouldn 't want to spend christmas day alone in here .
what about my neck ?
it 's a shame there aren 't more men in the world like you .
too much . eighteen hundred .
don 't worry .
jack .
all right , mr reynolds .
i can see .

i read that with a quantum increase of seven .
look , bomb ...
doolittle , are you there ?
it 's talby . he 's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack .
time to start talking .
he just likes it up in the dome , that 's all .
in the beginning there was darkness , and the darkness was without form and void .
i 'll check it .
commander powell is dead .
yeah , the skipper always was lucky .
i like to keep it professional , that 's all .
you haven 't figured this out yet , have you ? you walk in here thinking you 're gon na cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging ... but see it 's really the other way around . you think i 'm the whack , when actually you 're the whack .
what ? where 're we going ?
no time .
i got overhead ...
shhh ! don 't do that !
we 're just a little tense right now ... it 's okay .
we didn 't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night .
logan cale .

amanda finch . her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit . play your cards right and you could hit paydirt . she like 'em young . and since you look a little new at this , let me give you three words of advice . hard to get . think it , act it , know it , be it . nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games .
believe it .
i don 't care . i wan na hear more .
maybe some tunage 'll chase those blues away .
totally . all i 've had for chow was a packet of pop rocks and a yoo-hoo .
oh , i 'll remember it till the day i die . his name was ... simpleton the simian ? no , samson samoan ... no , simply , similar ...
stellas . i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs .
yo , doofus !

disco inferno ? disco 's infernal morelike .
uhh ... nothing .
just keep your lying , heathenous trap shut , jeremiah .
i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth ! lord have mercy ! !
i had a nightmare once that something like this might happen . i hope he doesn 't get grounded again . if he misses peter criss 's drum solo , i don 't know if he 'll be able to handle it .

you know what they say about a big ass ... big shit .
we won ? !
huh . st. bernard 's . figures it 's named after a canine .

a lot of people . teachers . younger kids . it 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason . but that 's ok ... because i know i deserve it .
a famous linguist once said ... that of all the phrases in the english language , of all the endless combinations of words in all of history ... that `` cellar door '' is the most beautiful .
no . that 's stupid .
congratulations .
i would like to put him through more hypnotherapy ... and increase his medication .
but let me remind you that this treatment is ... experimental .
you 're not a bitch .
if you think michael dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out , then i think you 're misinformed .
i think we 've all seen `` bonanza '' .
let 's go to donnie 's house . his parents are both at work .
i stole four beers from my dad .
don 't let that worry you , annette !
no . mom said if i did , she 'd look up my dad and marry him .
oh , yeah , sure . you know , every pageant is special , but this one is extra-special to me . when i was seventeen , i don 't know if you know this , but i was crowned mount rose 's american teen princess . and this year ... drum roll please , my lovely daughter , rebecca ann leeman is competin ' .

a.k.a . minneapolis -- st. paul .
oh , my ! hello , father donigan ! sidewalks , sidewalks ?
he could be playing solitaire , but i don 't think so .
i don 't know about us , but i know he's-a got something ...
who said i had a gun ... gim me those plans , you paper snatchers --
carry out this tragic folly if you will -- but i for one will not be a part of it . i will stay here in freedonia .
yes , but i 'll talk to you about that when we 're alone ...
tired ! i 'd like to stretch this into a week -
you can keep it -- i 've got a whole pack ... now what were you saying ?
well , maybe i am a little headstrong ... but , you know , it 's awfully hard to forget what he called me .
what ?
perhaps he will listen to you ...
oh ?
how lovely .
i don 't know . i can 't explain it . if this is an intelligent man , trapped in the body of a monster , then i 'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind , free that spirit as best i can , to help him live as full and content a life as possible . but ! if he 's an imbecile , who 's body i can 't treat and who 's mind i can 't touch , well , then my obligation is discharged . they can put him where they will ; he won 't be bothered , i won 't be bothered , and everyone 's conscience can remain free and untroubled . and that is my dilemma ... what is in his mind ?
i 'll show you ! i 'll show you !
right ... right .
indeed !
of course . how long did you and mr. treves prepare for this interview ?
yes , of course ... well , it 's been a pleasure meeting you , mr. merrick . good day .
what a mess .
oh nothing ... nothing of any great importance .
he 's imbecile , no doubt from birth . he speaks , but ... it 's all gibberish . no , the man 's a homeless idiot ... i pray god he 's an idiot .
yes .
yes .
yes ... well , good day , mr. merrick .
hello ... my name is john merrick . i am very pleased to meet you .
oh yes ! it is much better than what i am used to .
i promise you . you will never see the inside of that horrible place again . you will never , ever go back to the workhouse ... or that man . it 's a splendid room , don 't you think ?
i 'm not used to such kindness . from a beautiful woman .
yes , soon i will start the main spire , but i must finish these columns first , how kind of her !
you don 't think it 's too gaudy , do you ?
you 're losing your temper !
but , father , it is !
well , my dear , i think you 'll find it 's all a question of what you want to believe in ... . i have slightly more experience of these matters than you ...
no ! wait ! erik ! the cloak ! the cloak invisible ! it only seems to work on my father !
i must look ! keitel ! hold this !
not quite ...
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods ... so ... i disguised myself to sabotage their plans .
that i can not tell you .
that 's very kind of you , but we 're in rather a hurry ... we 're ...
you 've got to let me go !
well ... no ...
he was lucky ... sit there .
it saved my father !
no .
you don 't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make `` friends '' .

that 's my boy !
well , you are !
row ! row ! row !
sorry .
shut up . you there . you there and you there .

anyhoo , sweetie , i done a bad thing . i kinda sorta wrecked your car ...
i 'm excited , too . oh , and i wanted to give you this . it 's a little ... thing .
it 's gorgeous . just my taste . i 've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked . thanks . so let 's get going . long drive .
oh christ i didn 't kill anybody . it 's just a fucking dent . you 're like some old lady or something .
it 's you ! it 's you who can 't commit to anything ! you have no idea how lucky you are i 'm interested in you ! i don 't even know why i am ! i should just end it right here , joel . leave you in the zoo . maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with !
this kid , joe early , is going to beat the shit out of me .
i love it !
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers .
oh .
i don 't know .
what if ?
joel , come here . please .
joel , we 've fucked . we 've made love . like a million times . and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night . isn 't that lovely ?
i 'm like a joke to them .
clementine . i should just maybe talk to her .
this is it . the night we met . my god , it 's over .
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf .
i didn 't want to go . i was too nervous . i thought , maybe you were a nut . but you were exciting . you called from upstairs .
in a minute .
i don 't know . i 'm not sure there 's a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny .
nah , i don 't know .
go .
this guy 's only half cooked . there 's no time to fuck around , stan .
december 15th , 2004 . i met someone tonight . oh , christ : i don 't know what to do . her name is clementine and she 's amazing . so alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive . things with naomi and i have been stagnant for so long .
she came to help , howard .
yeah , probably a good idea .
oh dear .
that 's fine , stan .
thanks , stan . thanks .
thanks , stan . i owe you .
neither do i ... ha ha ho ho hee hee .
ha ha ho ho and hee hee .
like what ?
so if the ship didn 't blow up , what happened ?
don 't start with me , cooper .
everybody shut up ! let the man speak .
on my way .
what about the accumulator ... ?
we 're still venting trace gasses , gim me twenty minutes to plug the hole .
you 're okay now , it 's over ...
hurry .
no time . we need whatever 's left in our suits to repair the clark . like it or not , this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers .
goddammit , dj , it was not a hallucination ! i saw a man , he was on fire . and then he disappeared .
we 'll make it .
i apologize for the short notice , bill , but we 've had something come up that requires your immediate attention . lyle ?
navigation control tried to hail the vessel . this was the only response .
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt , she 's docked in bay four .
starck !
start the countdown .
so where are they ? starck , any luck with the bio-scan ?
i don 't know , this place is really dark , i can 't see a thing ...
there 's no one here , skipper .
what you got , peters ?
justin .
the clock is running , dr. weir . if you 'll follow the rest of the crew , they 'll show you to the gravity tanks .
peters and i will search the forward decks . justin , take engineering . no hot-dogging , not on this one , alright ?
in an emergency , the charges detonate in series , destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship . that way , if the gravity drive malfunctions , the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat .
dr. weir 's right . get on board the event horizon . i 'll meet you at the airlock .
i don 't know .
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark , doctor , or you 'll find yourself looking for a ride home .
son of a bitch !
nooo !
where is it ?
love to .
starck , give me a read .
smith ? smith ! fuck !
let 's go .
come around to three-three-four ...
i thought you wanted an answer . and that 's the only one i have .
you better hurry . he 's engaged the override , we can 't open the inner door .
we 've got to shut it down , we 've got to ...
yes .
they 're explosive charges .
you 're at the bridge , ms. peters . you still haven 't seen any crew ?
not according to the computer .
skipper , justin just activated the door . it 's on a thirty second delay ...
she 's not ugly .
range 3000 meters and closing .
1000 meters ...
picking up magnetic interference .
no , there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind . it 's as if time just ... stopped for seven years .
i 'm alright . please .
you wouldn 't say that , if you could see me .
i 'm blind , not deaf . wan na come in ?
i like the sound of that .
i 'll schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
is it safe ?
well why didn 't you say so ? you want me to lift some weights or something ?
to help you . i 've run every test known to man . and they all yield the same result : the machine is ready .
he also said we 'd avoid that storm in space . and we know how that turned out .
just get back soon , or i start looking for a new groom .
out front ? you home , baby ? i got a surprise for you .
deb , it 's me . it 's still me .
i already got it . everything i want .
you 'd never know it .
i 'm sure he 's matured since then .
should ?
ben . this is serious . turn around .
if we 're going to identify the source of the mutation , we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes .
this isn 't permanent , johnny . we need to be careful until we 're normal again .
ben , i don 't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse . i need you to be patient for a little while longe --
keep talking , there won 't be a next time .
give me the god damn mirror !
go back to the drawing board .
really ? with a name like von doom ? never saw that one coming .
hey , i 'm mr . sensitivity now . clear the way , wide load coming through .
that 's terrible news ...
i don 't know if `` we 've '' noticed , but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window --
ben , are you there ?
you 've been working out .
what he 's trying to say is : every team needs a mascot ...
oh , it is .
keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
johnny .
girl ... ? !
you gave us names ? what are you , the `` face '' of the fantastic four now ?
no , i 'm sorry , for pushing you out .
showtime .
recording , sir . we see you perfectly .
later . first , i 've got some unfinished business . a deal that needs closing ...
never better .
i was talking about us . working together .
it 's been changed .
well , he 's welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny ...
let 's not jump to conclusions , we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap .
what ... ? oh .
no . there weren 't . there was you . and me . no variables , no math . it was actually the simplest thing in the world . but your head got in the way ... like it always does .
no way to know . without more tests , experiments .
i gave him twenty .
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
a gasket ? reed , we 're at a party .
not at all .
hilarious .
reed , we 're running out of time .
it 's too late for him , and soon it 'll be too late for all of us .
which is precisely the point . analysis is over . it 's time for action . my men could have mass-produced this by now .
just find him .
arnold . what 's happening ?
come on , spicoli . why don 't you just put your shirts back on ? see the sign ?
it 's just linda . and mark from school .
brad . please don 't tell mom and dad ...
ugh .
nice to meet you .
oh , really ?
o-kay , you guys can come swimming . but you have to leave as soon as my mom gets home . okay ?
mark is a really nice boy ...
sure . come on in .
mike . i want you to know that i 'm pregnant .
i know it 's yours .
what do you mean ? men have died trying to obtain this information . i will give it to you for free .
all right . pay attention .
okay . see ya .
chicken !
you 're crazy . those girls love me .
whatever you say , rat .
totally .
this ain 't no cop .
they 're fuckin ' with us .
you know the thing i love about mustangs ? the steering wheel .
hey , mon , i don 't know what your trip is , but ...
believe it .
i know .
oh , give me a break , stacy . you 're much prettier than them .
no .
i know . he hates to have to wear uniforms .
i don 't know ... i just don 't feel right .
and you , my friend . i 'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week .
all right ! oh , yeah !
i know , everyone says that .
how about your phone number ?
it is . it 's very warm . i wonder how long it will last ?
oh ... yes .
sure thing .
i 've heard that , too .
not at all .
two more cokes .
me , too . i 'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck .
thanks . so ... what do you want to do ?
oh , yeah . i had mr. deegan .
i know everybody says it , but i really mean it .
i 'll have one more coke ... do you want another coke , stacy ?
listen , you fuzzy little shithead -- i 've been fucked around , in my time , by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it 's my turn . `` fuck you , officer , i 'm in charge here , and i 'm telling you we don 't have room for you . ''
not where we operate .
no more of that talk or i 'll put the leeches on you .
what do you expect ? i 'm your attorney . you owe me five bucks . i want it now .
where 's the ether ? this mescaline isn 't working .
you drive ! i think there 's something wrong with me .
what for ?
you 'll go straight to the gas chamber . and even if you manage to beat that , they 'll send you back to nevada for rape and consentual sodomy . she 's got to go .
i felt like a nazi , but it had to be done .
they were all veterans .
hurry up with those drinks . we 're thirsty . only two rums . make mine a bloody mary .
they 'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs .
yeh ... this foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry !
we had abused every rule that vegas lived by -- burning the locals , abusing the tourists , terrifying the help . the only chance now , i felt , was the possibility that we 'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it .
nobody . i 'm the maid !
no ! i swear i 'm not !
why not ? it was getting warm anyway .
yes ! i 'll help you all you need ! i hate dope !
you and a lot of other people .
don 't be stupid , drop the gun !
he 's right , let 's move . be quiet and get to the exit . pair up , grab the weapons .
i don 't wan na go home alone ... i don 't wan na see what might have ...
but it 's got teeth .
with what just happened upstairs --
gon na stay for a couple ?
c'mon guys --
come on , come on .
and the head ?
easy .
just move !
buddy , i 'm a full-blooded chucktow . i can 't think of a time my people haven 't been takin ' it dry . the fact that we are being eaten now , doesn 't even faze me ... ... this is just another tuesday .
uh , uh , i think if we can get everyone into it ... we can get out of here .
but not flush against the tunnel ?
just cover me . it was built to move .
you don 't understand sweety , daddy doesn 't pay , daddy sees the show for free . but you do get points for being horny on a night like this .
no one goes anywhere alone . least of all , unarmed .
get outta here .
they 're probably on to the next buffet by now . there 's a retirement home up the road . they 'd be easy .
you smell like ass !
if he doesn 't shut up ...
there 's a bomb shelter over in durant , by the iga , on first . you all know where that is ?
amazing you made it this far .
is there any other way out of this place ? anyone ?
right . were going to need some fire power . do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here ? anything at all ?
so we 've got guns , kitchen knives , pipes , fire and sticks .
that 's fine .
that 's one piece of four problems .
i 'd love to .
um , my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present , sir .
i just hit it like you said .
you see : we 've got to change that name .
sure , claire . if you don 't mind walking my way .
what ?
frances , we got ta do it this way . just remember tomorrow , remember what i told you . what 're you gon na tell 'em ?
francie , you 'll learn that sometimes it 's best to stay low and just walk away .
be careful , francie .
i pity us , dad . i pity us both .
why , you ... you little bastard !
you 've looked a whole lot better . c'mon .
i got your number , mister man .
i love you too , frances .
oh . why , harry york . how nice to see you .
'golden boy . '
are you crazy ? unhand that woman ! that 's amelia earhart !
frances , you remember my lawyer , alma styles ?
please . i want you to . it would make me so happy .
no . no , it all depends on what offers i get .
no , mama , i 'll take care of it . i 'll wash them in the morning .
she 'll never be yours ! she said my name ! she remembers !
there , there ... shhh ...
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a `` pompous ... fellow ... ''
nothing can . not ever .
it 's not ours to decide . all that live must die . it 's god 's will .
the world is a dizzying place .
he needs to vent his outrage to the skies ! make yourself heard , willie ! learning to walk is not an easy thing ! why should it be so ?
all my life i 've known .
i know only that he is a killer . and i shall bring back his carcass .
i 'm all right . i 'm safe ,
it wouldn 't dare .
very well then .
come now . magnus ? agrippa ? next thing you know , you 'll be teaching toadstools to speak .
somebody has to !
nothing in moderation , clerval .
it was wrong , henry ! it shouldn 't have happened ! the bastard deserves to die .
let it go .
despite the lack of challenge .
the strain was evident .
bill -- bill -- bill is out there ...
i will protect you .
i finished the boats .
everybody except the girl who 's supposed to handle the kitchen . annie .
i 'm not sure i 'll last all week . i 'll tell steve .
un-hunh .
i don 't know .
almost five .
and then steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don 't care about children ...
slipped in . probably liked the scent of your perfume .
not if they 're where i think they are .
okay .
wet . i don 't know .
it 's over twenty miles to the crossroads . steve 'll be back in an hour . things will straighten out then . we 'll take his jeep and get help .
i can 't , barry ...
here we go .
don 't get up . take a second ...
a short somewhere .
where 's ned ?

wait , wait ! when i was finding these goodies in the shed . i also found this letter which a camper never sent home . listen .
boy , we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here . wait a minute , i 'll get my diaphragm and be right with you .
lead the way !
there you are dead wrong .
frankly , scarlet , i don 't give a damn !
but it 's in the brochure ! `` camp crystal lake has a full drama program . '' you just saw it .
sure .
did they look like psychos ? they were fuckin ' vampires . psychos don 't explode when sunlight hits 'em , i don 't care how crazy they are .
i have no idea .
to keep the daylight out ! this is where they sleep ! get to the door !
just listen to daddy , sugar , and don 't do nothin ' stupid . you two , simon says sit the fuck down !
shit , i been to bars make this place look like a fuckin ' 4-h club .
forever together .
yeah , i know what 's going on . we got a bunch of fuckin ' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin ' blood ! that 's it , plain and simple . and i don 't wan na hear any bullshit about `` i don 't believe in vampires '' because i don 't fuckin ' believe in vampires either . but i do believe in my own two fuckin ' eyes , and with my two eyes i saw fuckin ' vampires ! now , does everybody agree we 're dealin ' with vampires .
other places have beds , they also have cable tv , a gym , room service ...
no , i 'm not . i 've been bit . in effect , i 'm already dead .
sure .
in the morning , darlin ' , in the morning , we are g-o-n-e and you are f-r-e-e. now , i know i put you guys through hell , and i know i 've been one rough pecker , but from here on end you guys are in my cool book . scotty , help me pick richie up , and lay him down . jacob , keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says , `` digayo . '' when you get to digayo , turn this big bastard left , go on down for a few miles , then you see a bar called `` the titty twister . '' from what i hear , you can 't miss it .
okay .
you use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you .
what ? are you kidding ? i didn 't do anything !
he signaled the ranger .
seth , he did it . you were by the beer cooler with your back turned . i was by the magazines , i could see his face . and i saw him mouth :
actually , our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man . he 's a preacher .
o'neil . our air 's gon na crap out as soon as we get down there . you know that , don 't you ?
i 'll act surprised .
'snot me . it 's him .
flea , 'cool , cortez , newman -- take your minis , hit the water . go , go !
thanks , wick .

nearly four years ...
sure i was . i thought lucy was gon na kill me .
we know , audrey .
perfect ! you wanted a story , well , baby , you got one .
yes . definitely . definitely enough .
only one way to find out .
oh yes he will .
but we can get to the west side faster .
no .
oh , just some insurance guy .
listen , this is the time when the big boys have to go to work , okay honey ?
me too .
i 'll try .
that is when we will go in .
they are with me !
this is america . there is nothing you can not buy .
makes us look more american .
let 's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres .
you were right .
good idea .
open .
`` just ! ? ''
must be some sort of mining facility .
kill it ? well i 'm open to ideas ! ...
jason , what have you gotten us into ?
they 're drifting toward me ... i think they 're magnetic ! ...
... sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps ...
dear god ... . how did i come to this ?
oh can 't i ? watch me !
all this from watching the.. historical records ?
shit ! i 'm doing it ! i 'm repeating the damn computer !
it doesn 't make sense ... surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures ...
down there .
by grabthar 's hammer , this is true . 159 nt . living room - somewhere - night 159
he probably ... has some very important business to attend to ...
guys , we 're sustaining structural damage ! ...
we need another one .
no , we don 't have an extra beryllium sphere .
listen fred . you did this for four years on the show . you can do it now ... put your hands on the controls..
oh i make it up . use lots of `` k '' s and `` v '' s .
you ... know us ?
it 's ... incredible .
the lost footage . at the convention . the mysterious device in our last episo -- historical document .
do i ? do i ? for all you know i 'm just `` crewman # 6 '' ! okay , it 's fleegman ! guy fleegman ! there ! now i 'm a whole person ! i can 't die ! fleegman ! they can 't kill me now , can they ? can they ?
of course they 're cute now . but in a second they 're going to turn mean and ugly somehow and then there are going to be a million more of them ! ...
let 's get out of here before one of those things kills guy .
we 're doing episode 31 , jason ?
all right , let 's all settle down . if we 're going to get through this we 're going to have to exercise self control .
let 's just pick up the pace a little , shall we ?
no . keep all energy to the armor .
hey , you want to drive ?
you know it 's one thing to treat us this way , but how can you do this to your fans ? ...
let me think . i need time to think .
mathesar , maybe we should get some of your crew up here .
i don 't think that 's a cloud ...
computer , do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard ?
don 't be ridiculous .
it helps .
nothing . hold please .
what the hell are you talking about ?
wait ... jason , here ! ...
mark 12 .
tommy , 270 degree turn to port !
tomorrow morning , before the store opening .
almost as much as he loves himself .
don 't do it , tommy . he 's not worth it .
i don 't know guys ... i mean , he almost looked ... sincere . i know , it 's bizarre !
i can 't ... it 's on autopilot ! ...
i see them ! i see them ! rd street pasadena 57
okey dokey , let 's fire blue particle cannons full . fire red particle cannons full . fire gannet magnets left and right . fire pulse catapults from all chutes . and throw this thing at him too , killer .
better than my lieutenant . he failed to activate ship 's neutron armor as quickly as i 'd hoped on our last encounter .
please , don 't hurt them , it 's not their fault . i 'm not the commander , i don 't know anything .
this is embarrassing , really . i shan 't tell this story when i return home .
it was a lot of fun . you kids are great .
i didn 't say that . i said `` wouldn 't it be great if we could always , work together . '' that 's what i said .
it 's as far as it goes !
good work , tommy . let 's go !
they always say that .
congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores !
i ? you all know my history .
yes , william . i am apologizing .
well , general , i think i ain 't got no school learning , i ain 't got no trade ... and i 'm a drunk . so , i think there ain 't much left to be set free .
we better , congress invented him .
get the body of our army up to greene 's vanguard as fast as we can . all the damned fool has to do is hit the british rearguard and then hold for us .
colonel hamilton . anyone who served under arnold , i want them shipped north . i don 't want any troops here who served under arnold .
no one knows ...
march on philadelphia ! get joseph reed , and the pigs in congress , the speculators , who 've grown fat off the war ! get them all ! sweep them aside !
yes , an astonishing power over weak minds .
if he isn 't , then he 's stupid .
these men have suffered but i believe they will fight .
when the snow melts , mon petite marquis , i suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red british soldiers .
i will continue with our french allies , concentrating on new york .
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now . my father is an ironmaster . as was i .
you have a free tongue , captain hamilton .
then , maybe i do see what you 're after -- perhaps ... you get to chose again ...
you 've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in ! it 's all right boys , i 'm here !
it is ; we need you george .
that 's just my interpretation . actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners . you see ? walk in a gently 'z ' . there are four distinct movements ...
it 's stupid , of course .
perhaps you best ask , why you wish it . you asked william to teach you manners , philosophy , decorum ... as i said , it 's completely stupid .
what else should i become ? there 's no difference between virginia and england . i must be educated if i 'm to take my place in society . my father couldn 't afford to send me to england for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes . everyone laughs at me .
though , sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season .
this , this is life indeed ! life worth preserving , such life as juba never felt till now .
don 't be silly , you have whole worlds to fathom .
yeah , well , i 'm bored , bear . i wan na make movies .
i went to uc san diego . we 're gon na spend the weekend at the universal sheraton . we 're gon na take the tour . see the shark . check out the miami vice action spectacular . after , we 'll come here , get our money .
harry , let me answer that .
yeah , well , we need a ride somewhere , we 'll let you know .

we just did . i told you my name 's chili palmer .
you look okay to me , harry . come over here and sit down . tell me what you been up to .
harry , lem me give you some advice .
karen , it 's a pleasure . how you doing ?
what i did till recently . after i get done here i 'll think about what i 'm gon na do next .
get the fuck outta my chair .
cash . it happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport .
hey , bones , looks like you 're gon na have a nice scar up there . maybe these guys can fit you with a rug , cover it up for ya .
good-looking , too . like karen .
you 're not going to tell me the rest ?
buddy ?
at eighteen percent , okay ? and don 't ask me no more fuckin ' questions . i 'm leaving .
i just caught the end .
yeah . we understand you read the script and like it ... a lot .
whichever . let 's talk about it tomorrow .
continental , but it doesn 't matter . martin won 't order from the menu .
oh , shit ... i 'm sorry ... i thought that was ... i 'm so sorry ...
he happens to be loaning me five hundred grand , no strings , i write any kind of agreement i want .
hello , martin .
i know . i 'm doing shylock instead of a shylock . okay , what 's my motivation ? the acquisition of money . to collect . inflict pain if i have to .
arctic warrior , passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three . over .
affirmative , arctic warrior . the vessel chimera was registered to the dobbins kirk line , halifax . nova scotia . date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two . over .
i 'll sleep good tonight knowing that .
with that coxswain dickhead .
nah . everything was cool . it 's just one of those things .
it 's a beautiful country . very clean . very civilized . and cold .
yeah . hell , what difference does it make if we report it now or later ? we call this in now , gon na be coastguard , fbi , who knows who , all over the place .
ever heard of insurance , big boy ?
or uninvited guests .
thanks for the warning -- ow ! damn !
i tell you one thing , we 're not gon na be towing no ship now .
i 'm telling you , i saw somebody . i don 't know who it was . but i saw somebody .
maybe he isn 't alone .
seen a lota movies .
why not ?
are you kidding me ? jealous ? epps ? gim me a break .
the sooner we get under way , the sooner we are to spending what 's ours .
we 'll stand a watch . four on , eight off . low man first .
could be meant as a warning .
if they knew what they were carrying .
right .
he 'd let you off at the nearest port , that 's for sure .
cargo like this could make a crew think twice .
probably didn 't have time .
we don 't exactly have the best bargaining position .
dodge , get on that turbine . i don 't care if you don 't sleep for a week . the sooner you 're done , the sooner we can get out of here . how 's the food situation ?
no cowboy shit . right .
doesn 't matter .
i don 't know what else you 'd call her . one second she was there , the next she was gone .
just lucky i guess .
leave him till we can get some help . from now on , nobody comes down here .
red sky in morning , sailor take warning .
looks like it 's adrift .
yeah .
we leave it where it is . stick to the plan .
would you hold on just a minute here , please ? look , there 's no reason to panic now . epps saw somebody . fine . it 's a big boat . chances 're real good he doesn 't even know about the gold . if we stay cool , nobody 'll be the wiser . the gold stays where it is til we 're ready to go . like i said , it 'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here .
maybe .
drink up then .
alright . everybody grab your gear ! this ' is where we get off !
the coast guard has our last position . they 'll send somebody out soon enough . a ship this size you can 't exactly miss .
must 've heard something below deck and went down to check it out .
whyn 't you mind your own business , chief .
oh i love to cook . i guess most women wouldn 't invite a man over on the first date , but i believe you should trust your instincts . when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so ... i don 't know ... harmless . ready for ice cream ?
enid . it 's sort of like a diary i guess .
oh my god , that 's him !
i guess .
this is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again ...
i know , she needs to die immediately .
we should follow them !
i feel as though i 've stepped into a time warp !
you loser !
isn 't it weird ? it 's her favorite .
what a little hosebag .
it 's still twenty-five minutes early .
i 'm going to tell him you said that .
what exactly is a cardigan anyway ?
oh my god , he just ordered a giant glass of milk !
come on , it 's too late now ...
somewhere downtown .
it 'll only take a second .
aw c'mon , this is a fun party .
wait ...
oh yeah right , like i 'm gon na let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus .
oh , hey enid ... so ... we finally made it !
where did you get those pants ?
sure ! ... wait , maybe not 78s , but i can play regular records ...
c'mon , seymour , please ?
let the machine get it . i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me ...
what about this ?
i could never move - i 've got too much stuff .
he has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody !
it 's a tampon in a teacup ...
as are they all .
i am desperate to see africa- but i hate the leaving .
does he speak english ?
i 've got medical supplies to deliver . come along to the hospital when you 're done .
nobody 's seen anything like this . lions don 't have caves like this- -they 're doing it for pleasure .
the most of any lions ... a hundred ... ? probably more . johnny ... ?
because they are here . because tsavo is the worst place in the world . come , john- to the bridge .
this is more difficult-
clearly you don 't agree about building the railroad ?
fine . get started . and a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night . send half your men to the bridge , the rest with these two . and i 'm sorry for my tone earlier . but i repeat- there is no reason for fear . i will kill the lion and i will build the bridge .
look out , samuel , here it comes .
he doesn 't . he needs nobody . but we have hunted many times ... ... he knows i am afraid of lions ...
i don 't believe you had a mother .
not even close . what happened ?
oh , i 'm sorry . this is peter venkman . peter , janosz poha .
i 'm not saying you did . in science we always look for the simplest explanation .
i 'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field . it 's a theory ray and i were working on when we had to dissolve ghostbusters .
okay , let 's take a look .
as a matter of fact , i stopped by to tell you that i haven 't forgotten your problem and that we 're still on the case .
peter , this is very nice , but you don 't have to do any of this , you know .
yes , i 'm very clean . did they find anything at my apartment ?
finally came to your senses , huh ?
same difference .
so what ? it 's a free country . thanks , lib .
ghostbusters .
how are you ? what 's that you 're working on , johnny ?
well , i 'd make an exception in this case if i were you .
my pleasure .
not . don 't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities . we 'll be back .
sorry , your honor , but when somebody sets me up like that i can 't resist .
you 've got to stop them . please !
okay , let me rephrase that question . didn 't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children ?
yes .
did i forget something ?
objection . irrelevant and immaterial .
yeah , you would . is that for personal or professional reasons ?
i knew that .
you need the exercise .
it 's a rough translation from the moldavian .
they love you , lib . keep it up .
his nickname is `` the hammer . ''
something good --
do it ! just do it !
you mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes ' ?
there 's something very familiar about this painting .
it 's an interesting one , pete . if anything was going on it 's totally subdued now .
okay , let 's heat 'em up !
if he wasn 't dead he 'd be an olympic prospect .
no , i 'm just restoring it to its normal state .
nothing . just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub . but we did turn up some interesting stuff on this vigo character you mentioned . i found the name vigo the carpathian in leon zundinger 's magicians , martyrs and madmen . listen to this :
i hate jello .
good effort . now what ? should we say supportive , nurturing things to it , ray ?
only one way to find out . ready , teddy ?
we 're almost there , lib . step on it .
yeah , and a lot easier to get to than that island .
me ? i 'm a little of everything . some irish , some german , some french , dutch -- the women in my family slept around . and that 's what made this country great .
now if you don 't want to be the -- -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift , i suggest you get down behind that desk and don 't move until we give you the signal `` stabilize -- all clear . ''
don 't you see ? it 's the slime . that stuff is like pure , concentrated evil .
groovy . i 've never felt better in my life .
some people like the attention . some people are just crazy .
i am zuul . i am the gatekeeper .
back off , man ! i 'm a scientist !
we 'll get back to you .
probably a mixture of gases , no doubt stolen from the army ...
if you turn that thing off we won 't be responsible for the consequences .
no ! them ! shoot them ! cross the beams .
god , it 's ugly !
the storage facility blew . this one ... ... shut off the protection grid .
ray , i apologize . i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced . they did this to galileo , too .
maybe . but no one ever advertised before .
this might do ... i don 't know ... it just seems kind of `` pricey '' for a fixer-upper , don 't you think ? we 're trying to keep our costs down . you know how it is when you 're starting a new company .
i can 't take much more of this . the pace is killing me .
it 's not good , pete .
i don 't think it 's shandor .
forget the trapping ! just blast him !
right . we 'll believe anything .
later , man ! !
what do you mean `` choose ? '' we don 't understand .
why ? then they 'll notice when i 'm gone . well . i 'm making a public appearance aren 't i ?
maybe you should get married . pick one of your cousins , it would demonstrate a profound stability .
if you get me pregnant with a boy he 'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne .
i 'm sure , i don 't know .
you can 't do that ! you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you .
do we really need to repair this fort ? it seems like an expensive undertaking . i propose we burn it to the ground . that way if the germans cross the danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position .
we have to stop the germans now !
quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory . they will hear that you are living in luxury . he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life . and soon the army won 't even remember your name .
i wouldn 't know who to bet on .
i met with falco , and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans .
he must have been . he was on the list of prisoners to be executed .
the exact month when the emperor must be confirmed !
they can 't ... if this is rome ...
narcissus ! terrified ? you ? the only thing he 's scared of is me .
yours will do !
much more colorful than the ones we wear . and , of course , less dented .
let 's hope he doesn 't start giving orders .
i 've been overseeing production myself for the past three years , you 'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become .
chain him .
don 't be ridiculous .
are you mad ? with all this unrest the colosseum will be open day and night ! anyway , i 'm not political , i 'm in the entertainment business .
yes .
i don 't know . they must think i look like this guy gladstone .
it just happened . it was just this thing that happened along with everything else . can you understand that ?
if you want .
i don 't know .
why wouldn 't it ?
look -- she 's all right . she 's upset and she screamed . but she 's okay now .
benjamin -- i am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion . now if you won 't do me a simple favor i don 't know what .
for god 's sake , benjamin , will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse ?
what ? oh -- no -- i 'm just --
it 's down the hall .
look -- i drove you home . i was glad to do it . but i have some things on my mind . can you understand that ?
yes , i have --
nervous . well , i am a bit nervous . i mean it 's -- it 's pretty hard to be suave when you 're --
i think we have everything quite under control now , benjamin . would you like a quick drink before you go ?
i 'd like you to know my sister , miss dewitte --
hello , mrs. robinson .
goodnight .
oh , ben -- this is so -- exciting --
we haven 't .
no -- it 's not . it 's completely baked . it 's a decision i 've made .
could i speak to you for a second , dad ?
twenty-one-years-old , ladies and gentlemen ; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation 's leading seats of learning --
it 's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends .
your bank , mr. kringelein .
every glass high to life -- the splendid , dangerous , mighty , brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it . baron , you know -- i 've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --
i 'll go . -- i love you . i 'll be on that train . i 'll get the money .
don 't worry . i 'll be on the train . he leaves .
no thanks -- keeping my head clear .
i do drink , baron -- i drink to you , baron and to win . it 's good , -- come along , baron .
oh , no , stay here , baron -- stay .
please , baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is .
insolent -- berlin manners .
i did not ask your advice .
mr. preysing -- one sixty-four .
i have nothing better to do , mr. kringelein .
yes , thanks to the baron . the best shops , the very best . look , doctor , silk -- feels so nice on the skin ... a london hat , see -- made in england , that 's silk , too -- fifty marks ... look , the price is on it . that was half my salary before . the baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the baron .
for me ? -- oh , please , something sweet and cold .
no .
oh , there must be one in paris ... they have everything in paris .
perhaps .
yes , mr. preysing -- that 's what we want to know .
and i said we didn 't .
you 've talked enough today , you 're hoarse now .
what a session this has been .
he likes to play the great man .
the pearls won 't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck -- -- i hate them !
send it away -- i shan 't need it .
all right , suzette -- quickly -- hurry .
where is pimenov ? where is pimenov ?
the performance -- the performance -- the performance .
yes , pimenov . one minute , suzette , i will call you .
but when did he go ? how do you know ?
i certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one .
well -- gentlemen .
you work for me , huh ? then i just may flush you down the toilet . drive me to the durando .
on the square , huh ? and how are you making out these days ? stealing much ?
no problem . my husband gets up the crack of dawn . it 's his kidneys .
we 're not really interested , henry .
henry , no !
oh , cole , please . please come out of it . what would i do without you ?
my son will be all right . if he isn 't , i 'll have you killed .
why , of course it is . i can offer you -- well , five hundred dollars .
oh , sure . fine .
perk .
no . and you have to be .
he let me live . he let me be his friend .
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend .
we won 't hit the track . the beach . couple a nice restaurants .
no can do . have to dip in and out of my bag too much . besides , it 'll heal in the air .
don 't be sorry . you 're not taking it .
i have to have that money , roy . what do i have to do to get it ?
i don 't care about that . this time , i got ta have the rent .
you taught me a lot . then i invented .
always , for you , baby .
taking you for granite ?
i didn 't say that . you aren 't marriage material .
because it 's comfortable .
we 'll rent a car .
not many .
it 's for your cigarette . i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants .
that don 't match either of the victim 's .
broken blood vessels on her right forearm .
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains ...
girl scouts .
the door was open , so we let ourselves in .
toni blake from langley p.d .
will , sit down ...
i was trying to get away from someone .
afraid not . you can pick your friends , but you can 't pick your family .
please , get on the bus ...
is that all you guys can think about ? amy never came back last night . maybe she 's in trouble .
you think your mom knows we snuck out last night ?
i did alright .
shit , beth , why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin ' fair ? it 's only halloween .
reality check , dillweed . this is 1995 .
guess so ...
then they can watch .
the voice man ! he 's here !
okay ... but just for tonight .
you can 't expect us to stay here --
danny , you 're just going to have to wait !
you 'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach , kara .
it 's ... michael ... ... michael myers !
danny , go downstairs -- now !
here . let me try .
kara , no !
i 'm here now , jamie . you 're going to live . you have to .
an old friend .
i 'll meet you over there .
please -- just tell me the truth . has michael myers come home ?
no ! ! !
never mind the condition of your body and your spirit ! look after your things , your things !
buy yourself breakfast . there we go .
don 't !
stop !
there it is . give it to me .
i came back .
you were wrong , you quack !
yes -- well -- uh -- that 's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology . whenever you feel like it . it 's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that 's ringing loudly . your apology turns off the alarm .
comical ?
and terror , if you don 't mind .
i dunno . yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! i did .
i dunno .
men can touch other men , and it doesn 't mean a thing . haven 't you ever seen football players after they 've won the superbowl ?
dr. woodly ? you know who this is ?
oh ?
maybe it 's supposed to end now . maybe god wouldn 't have it any other way .
i believe in miracles now .
you fake ! you 're no better than the dumbest general in the pentagon . you 're not going to beat harold . you 're not going to beat anybody . you 're not going to stay here , either -- yammering and taunting until you 're most gloriously killed . go home !
then we 'd stay home and eat venison or something , and look through the scrapbooks . i 've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat . i 'm going to bring that boy back .
we can take off the `` wanda june '' with a butter knife .
you sure ? we have regular sessions , too . only twenty dollars ?
i tried to get more , but this is the limit . the de vries line has the same area .
yeah . how did you know ?
i am .
get out . get out of here , goddammit .
i just heard . who is he ?
go home , pilgrim . there 's nothing you can do . forget this place . start over .
you ain 't goin ' nowhere alone .
ratan !
let 's go .
no .
oh .
who ? van dorn ? you must be kidding yourself , honey . you think once that guy finds his daughter he 'll care about you ?
how do you do . i 'm mrs. chasen . come in .
well ...
is he ? ah , the police . always wanting to play games . well , here goes .
yeah . and it is cold in here . hello , glaucus .
really . just put it there , harold .
... of you . you 'll all end up like this .
well , they 're my species .
please ! she has got to see a doctor right away .
harold !
she 's a commie pig . we 're going to nail every last one ...
she took my head .
perhaps you 're teasing us . are you teasing us ?
i 'm your daddy now , kirsty .
i 'm a girl who keeps her promises .
you a doctor , too ?
oh yeah ? on your own a lot , huh ?
god , i wish i could say no . this is going to do terrible things to my attitude , you know .
hey , so for it . don 't let pity stop you . i 'm down . nail me .
the box ? like in your story ? like in his house ?
oh , pardon me . i obviously didn 't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value . no , you talk to me . but -- do me a favor ? -- none of this demons crap .
yeah .
the mattress ... the mattress ... julia .
oooh ! ! who was here ? nixon ? houdini ? you mind sharing your mystic insights ?
nothing psychic about it . you 're easy .
no , listen this : sammael , the desolate one , lord of the shadows , son of nergal --
i 'm lucky that way .
i dunno , maybe five seconds -- ow !
didn 't even buy me a drink .
red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
karl ruprecht kroenen , one of the reich 's top scientists . head of the thule occult society .
air and sea backup . what 's closest ?
from where ? ? ! !
no . it was red . bright red .
i think that is its hand .
is it bad ?
that 's not how she feels . she may never feel it .
oh , as opposed to -- ?
you 're doing fine .
this -- ? this is nothing . you know what 'll kill me ? her .
yup . sixty years old by our count . but he doesn 't age like we do -- think dog years : he 's barely out of his teens .
not so fast . he barely knows him --
father 's back ? still angry ?
oh-n-no -- i --
my arm is fine . where are you ? ?
that 's right , stud , hold me down .
well , let 's see -- there was that moment , when i had a train on top of my head --
not hungry .
just a scratch . i wanted to see you .
oh , okay then . maybe later then .
coffee 's warming me up .
sure .
it 'll go in .
do you really need this bed , lady ?
no tears please . it 's a waste of good suffering .
i could lead you right to him . you could take him back to hell instead of me .
no . that wasn 't the deal .
you can keep them .
what ? what will you do ? what can you do ? there 's nothing to be frightened of .
keep your voice down .
the best part of ten years .
i don 't know . probably wanted a hideaway .
it looks like a bomb 's dropped .
are you o.k . ?
o.k .
yeah , why don 't i ?
maybe i will .
steve .
i 'm not going to change my mind , dad .
of course .
so lie down .
what happened to you ?
what things ?
sure . why not ?
i didn 't know it was classified information . i mean , i know we don 't have any customers , but i thought that was a bad thing , not , like , a business strategy .
let 's pack it up . we haven 't had a customer in four hours .
ha .
yeah , you would say that , wouldn 't you ? you two have to stick together now . boners united . united in getting some .
no , you can 't .
do not get ahead of yourself .
it 's the new --
why ?
nobody .
he 's not worth it !
yeah . i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it .
can i help you ?
do it . do it .
yeah but more than that . i 'm happy because i 'm proud of us . because although our talents are small and peculiar , we use them to their best advantage .
yeah ... well ... i 'll see you tomorrow , rob .
you 're a horrible person , barry . i mean it .
i 've already left it , you pathetic rebound fuck ! now get your patchouli stink out of my store .
we won 't leave it , ian . not ever .
i should be so lucky .
don 't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection ?
no .
uh ... no .
i lived with you . you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you 're worried i might kill you , and you 're entitled to worry . isn 't that a terrible thing ? isn 't that sad ?
okay .
not really .
-- no , no , no , don 't even . i talked to laura , rob . i talked to her and she gave me a little background . and you 're a fucking asshole .
good .
yup . not far from here , actually .
this one came unassembled .
fine .
are you ?
there 's a catch . you 're supposed to wear 19th century clothing .
no . just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to . when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it . twenty years later i became the son .
it 's like to kill me first .
all living things pay dues , conor . they must be respected for that .
i 'll be back when i can .
not likely .
i had no choice .
have you time for some- thing to eat ?
good times then . a man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears . not like now .
-since you last saw me .
you were never a kid .
my quarry grows clever with age . and the others , incompetent .
should i care ?
why don 't you fellows get your own news ?
hildy !
it doesn 't have to rhyme !
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you .
it will be perfectly all right , walter . mother is coming with us on the train .
fine . and here 's a kiss for you .
it 's simple . a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down .
you haven 't seen anything yet .
certified ! i 'm afraid hildy 'd feel ashamed to think she hadn 't trusted you .
that 's all i ask . oh , wait a minute .
thanks a lot .
oh . i wonder what 's keeping mother ? she was supposed to come down and get you .
if she 's not there , mother and i are leaving anyhow !
you can 't bluff me , burns . i don 't care who you are or what paper you 're editor of .
i 'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is .
oh , trying to frame me , eh ! i never saw this woman before in my life !
your luck 's not with you now !
thank you .
call him a love-child , if you want to . duffy !
give him the works . hello , duffy , get set ! we 've got the biggest story in the world . earl williams caught by the morning post -- exclusive !
louie !
was she ? did you notice ?
what is it ? here !
who did you talk to ?
you -- you ! !
you know you did !
i was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them . they were hiding him !
western an ' thirty-fourth .
hildy -- i can 't . i 'm busy -- i -- let me up , hildy . earl williams has escaped --
oh , i 'm sorry . i forgot you were here . no , mr. williams , we still have some questions for you . sheriff , will you kindly extinguish the lights ?
good . now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions . did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun ?
i know , i just want to give him a thrill .
all right -- all right !
came up here -- had hysterics and passed out . i 've been trying to get her to come to .
aw , why don 't you let her alone ? she 's ill !
who 's this guy she 's gon na marry ?
well , if she 's gon na write fiction , there 's nothing like being a reporter .
what 's the use ? i can 't win a pot .
lioness rushes to defense of cub .
make them talk and you got williams , pinky !
now , where is he ?
probably goin ' out to get williams .
just coffee . and you , sir ?
that 's all right .
hang onto her ! keep her in here !
you 're certainly a hard fellow to find , sheriff .
no , i couldn 't do that .
we 're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented : 'reform the reds with a rope ' .
how would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month . that 's almost a hundred dollars a week !
now what do you say ?
just -- one -- second !
my name is louis peluso .
all right , judge .
what 's the matter ? getting yellow ?
i 'll take it . what 's the matter , mr. burns -- don 't you understand english ? -- why , your language is shocking , mr. burns -- positively shocking ! i don 't mind because i was married to you and know what to expect , but suppose central is listening in ... oh , did you hear that , central ? we ought to report him , don 't you think ? ... oh , fooey on you !
i thought so , too .
no -- what ?
from all i can get the sheriff let him out so 's he could vote for him .
i won 't , earl .
put down that gun , earl .
don 't move !
wait a minute , mollie .
ssh !
i 'll be right here . i won 't leave you .
yeah , i 'm feelin ' fine .
hello , mollie .
yeah , hold the line . hey , this looks good . an old lady just called the detective bureau and claims williams is hiding in her cellar . well - we 've looked every other place . want to go out on it ?
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn 't work , so --
i think you hit him , grandpa . he was limping when he ran off .
looking for shrapnel .
i only know one .
not now . they wouldn 't believe me .
we thought it was poison .
he 's the worst liar .
thanks , son . i can hear it . i 'm not sleeping , just closing my eyes .
the land and the king are one , my son . if he stutters we falter . he 's getting batter , and so are we .
i heard the drum and fife yesterday , mac , marching past . made my hair stand on end . i thought , i 've been asleep for twenty years .
bugger the buffs .
i will if you will !
and it was the last . hasn 't written a letter since . not even a birthday card .
you taste it .
not till christmas , i don 't suppose .
it 's only a joke , mummy . i 'm fifteen . i 'm still at school . i want to be a nun when i grow up .
it 's not . it 's happening to me .
could we salt them , or smoke them , do you think ?
why ? it 's coming on its own . it doesn 't hurt .
how many of our class left ? you and me out of twenty-eight .
it 's just the wrench , grace . it 's for their sake .
grace !
a polish pilot . it 's like one of those jokes on the wireless .
kids don 't care . you 're thinking of yourself .
i don 't mind it . it was harder before the war . trying to keep up appearances . now it 's patriotic to be poor .
please don 't kill us , please don 't kill us .
baby ! stop !
no , i told you ...
yeah , i like the screaming too ... it 's so much more exciting .
come on .
ok .
whoopie fucking doo .
nice .
holy crap , thanks !
hey , wait take this .
how long is a piece of string ? too god damn long , that 's how long .
i know , this is fucking nuts .
he won 't move .
yeah , showtime for what ?
man , it 's already ten thirty .
lock the fucking doors .
alright , alright . i know ... i wanted to be the photographer .
where ya headed ?
what ?
whatever it is just do it . the more we play along the faster we 'll get the hell out of here .
just sit back and enjoy the show .
i hear ya .
no , none . i had one once , back in '57 maybe ... i don 't know . really ain 't nobody we wan na be jaw flapping at around here no more .
he should be back in a couple hours .
how 's he get around out here ?
no dear , i 'm fine . now what kind of host would i be if i put my guests to this kind of work .
oh yeah , murder museum ... sounds fun .
fried chicken . anybody want some ?
that seems likely .
shhhhhh .
aw christ , jerry . we can 't see anything now , it 's too dark . let 's forget it .
i can 't believe ...
yeah , she said we looked queer .
bill , why don 't you ask her ... she 's your special friend .
yeah , it 's really your fault that we 're stuck in this shithole in the first place .
you said it , not me .
enough with the stupid voices .
i know the words ... fucking psycho fucking bullshit , that 's the words .
don 't worry , i 'm gone .
oh , come now ... we 're all creatures of god and freaks in our own way ... ... but if you 'll notice ... right here , needs a little something , heh ?
you , my dear worm feeder , are about to become immortalized .
no , i can 't say that i ever seen 'em before ... ... he looks familiar , is he on tv ?
what ! god damn , how many ?
shhhh ... you hear that ?
over here , inside the smokehouse .
i ain 't got a warrant .
oh , yeah , you know about that ? hmmm , that 's a strange one .
christ , you know it 's crazy ... i lived through so many other people 's nightmares , you know . always cool and calm , but ... but i never thought i 'd be the one needing help , ya know ?
i pray to god there is .
let 's hit the road , sooner we get a move on sooner we 'll find her .
uh ... we must never act like apes , son . for you see , the ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp . a single chromosome separates us . but you know what truly separates us from the apes , what makes us better than apes ?
that is the wrong fork , young man .
i like it when you say my name . is that stupid ?
shh .
nothing , my darling . all is right with the world .
shit . hi , honey .
terrific . we 're all going to be rich and famous .
i don 't know . something 's missing .
i don 't know .
with pleasure .
why certainly !
terrific . can 't wait !
nothing . be right out .
oh , nathan , let 's have a baby !
thank you very much for that .
i 'm loving this . it 's such a treat to be out and about . what a wonderful invention a city is . the immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun , the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks , the colorful street vendors .
it would be my pleasure , doctor . distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community , i stand before you today , a living testament to the amazing skill of dr. nathan bronfman . to say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement . dr. bronfman took me from playing with my own feces , then to crayons , and then to an appreciation of the complex works of franz kline , joseph beuys , and marcel duchamp . from compulsive masturbation to ...
here , here .
right .
oh , i forgot all about it . how 's the hands ?
we 're neighbors now . you can call me sarah .
it 's what eddie wants . he , uh , told me to give you some money .
you ever played billiards before ?
the night is two thousand dollars old .
what did he say ?
two .
nah . sit tight . he 'll be over here .
it 's all right . she had a little too much to drink , that 's all . forget it . go upstairs and sleep it off .
i said we 're leavin ' .
oh , come on , stop stalling . grab yourself a cue .
charlie , i 'm gon na take him .
if that 's all you got , that 's all we got left .
well , hello . haven 't seen you in a long time .
i don 't play pool , mr. felson . i play billiards . my house , my game . you don 't have to play if you don 't want to .
okay ?
i don 't rattle , kid . but just for that i 'm gon na beat you flat .
well , you 're right . i guess it wouldn 't .
no , stick around . can i get you something ? drink ? coffee ?
come here . come on , now .
so do you , fast eddie .
no .
listen to me , my blood somehow ... helped you . it could help all of you . we could find some way to --
dark and large . with vines -- no , not vines . not alive .
yes .
you 're not them .
before ... when i was one of them . i would look at this and it was just strangers . now i ... remember .
yes .
that 's mars . the closest planet to us , now . that 's why it 's more than just a point in the sky .
you 've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill !
sure ... fine .
was there anything over the hill ?
yes , mr. gardner .
maybe -- it landed in the bushes .
all their lines were busy .
hide the car .
yes ... yes , but i 'm not sure what i saw anymore .
what happened to your other slipper ?
what ? -- i ...
the back door was open .
fifty six minutes , forty five seconds .
david , don 't ...
we 'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off .
punched the president ? oh my god .
more than likely .
i could have evacuated the cities hours ago . you know , when i flew in the gulf war everything is simple . we knew what we had to do . it 's not simple anymore , connie . a lot of people died today . how many didn 't have to ?
please , would i be this panicked if it was that simple ?
we 've tried . it 's not working . it 's almost as though they weren 't even there .
you don 't move soon . i 'll begin to decompose .
moishe , please , don 't talk .
great .
just getting a feel for her .
looks like they 're preparing the invasion .
she should be shortly .
and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami , ft. worth , and memphis .
yes , sir .
i 'm a pilot , will . this is where i belong .
roger .
sir , i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately .
please , you 're not buying into any of this nonsense , are you ? we don 't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign . not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate .
he 's doing a good job .
funny , it used to scare me when i thought about the future . guess it doesn 't really matter anymore .
i thought you said you were doing to break it off .
don 't worry , big guy . i 'm sure she got out of here before it happened .
i didn 't take it . i thought i didn 't need it anymore .
you 're not going anywhere . you hear me ? i 'm still your father .
for once in your life think about what 's best for troy . who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up ? who ?
we 're leaving .
two words , mr. president . plausible deniability .
not all too dissimilar to us . breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold ... probably why they 're interested in our planet . hey , you wan na see them ?
and i am his .
the dog ! ? you are named after the dog ...
i don 't know . but whatever it is , he 's in over his head !
the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us .
it looks like a converted church .
where ?
it 's ... a leap of faith . oh , god .
it 's a rescue , old boy . come on .
got lost in his own museum , huh ?
i 'd rather spit in your face . but as i haven 't got any spit ...
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for .
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork .
he never would have made it past the rats ! he hates rats ! he 's scared to death of them !
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors .
don 't know . think of something .
how do you know ?
my father didn 't want it incinerated .
all i have to do is scream .
i 'm like a bad penny . i always turn up .
what about the boat ? we 're not going on the boat ?
fly ... yes . land ... no .
more or less . son , i 'm sorry . they got us .
dad , we 're well out of range .
who cares ? as long as they 're keeping donovan busy . dad , you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation .
i can get it -- i can almost reach it , dad .
junior ? ! dad ...
come on -- come on !
this is a different situation , dr. jones . these people are like children . we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century .
no , he 's a very shrewd old boy . power behind the throne and all that . he actually runs this whole province .
even if they were trying to scare us away , a devout hindu would never touch meat . makes you wonder what these people are ...
did you discover anything in that tunnel , dr. jones ?
finally !
i remember first hearing your name when i was studying at oxford . i am chattar lal , prime minister for his highness the maharajah of pankot .
you should have been there ...
i 'm afraid they 'll kill them ! we saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man 's heart out !
maybe ... but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace ?
kali ma protects us now and for ever , and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood !
i don 't like to show off .
sure , i found him . then last night i had a little trouble . somebody tried to slit my throat .
at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor !
sure , indy -- three tickets ! you , me and wu han --
it 's just superstition , shorty . like a ghost story .
nope , you got a little surprise over there , shorty .
just a statue .
okay , shorty ... see you in the morning ... i 'm going to have a little -- word with willie .
`` follow in the footsteps of shiva . do not betray his truth . ''
behind you !
read you loud and clear , indy !
nobody 's perfect . the way i heard it , you stole one of them from a small village .
you 're betrayed shiva .
they say we must pray to their evil god . we say we will not .
i 'm sorry , i don 't know how i can help you here .
who cares ? where 's that diamond !
relax , i 've been giving him lessons .
poison never agrees with me . pull a right , short round , and head for the wang poo bridge !
the airport ... no , look out , short round ! left , left !
since i was nice enough to let you tag along , why don 't you give your mouth a rest ? okay , doll ?
that 's more food than these people eat in a week . they 're starving , too ...
their children ?
keep stroking it !
i know the feeling ...
i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket .
well , when my nightclub career was run over by the depression , some pinhead convinced me that `` a girl could go places in the orient ... '' so , look where i got .
i 'd be safer sleeping with that snake .
just try and control yourself .
she might get away with that act here , but she 'd never make it in a real nightclub .
maybe he likes older women .
i 've never been so hungry in my life ...
i 'm a scientist . i like doing research on certain `` nocturnal activities '' --
you 're dreaming , willie . you want to make it real , just knock on my door .
what -- the bug ?
gee , i wouldn 't want to touch an ugly critter like that !
willie , open the door ! get us out of here !
willie !
no ... the heart 's still beating !
quiet !
they think i 'm insane . tell them i 'm not , indy . please -- help me ...
there 's got to be another way out .
what above the curves ? !
not quite .
willie , come on !
who 's you ?
what 's going on ?
that a new datsun ?
you said it .
can 't see a goddamn thi..
no . don 't tell the guards .
why ?
why don 't you just get out , leave me alone .
i can 't remember..
nothing !
well , if not to kill , then to bother and annoy .
we 'll change your appearance .
little late for that .
follow it .
what can i do ? you 're on your own .
what are you looking at ?
why not ? !
you have no taste .
who , me ?
shit ! you 're in love .
it wasn 't like that .
i can 't keep up .
that 's not funny .
it is a blank . this is no time for zen .
you think . that 's what you 're good at .
no . you can 't trust her .
you said 100,000 yen for the right sony walkman .
he didn 't . he left us that walkman chip to confuse us . would have kept most people busy . we were too fast for him .
aim what ?
and don 't let her know , either .
ought to be , they stole everything and reverse-engineered it . looks like all they need is the chip .
you 're lovely .
do what ? what 'd you do ?
dieter ?
then how did you know ?
surveilliance on them all .
we insist .
i think i 've heard of you .
of course you 're not . we 'll take good care of you .
much better now , thank you . just sit here quietly ... see there 's nothing to worry about ... just be my old self again ... .soon ...
a little voice in my head .
thanks , i appreciate that .
sir ?
sir ?
ahhh . good choice , sir .
i didn 't say anything .
... i 'm looking for someone .
... rene .
why 'd you run off ?
this is a tough place to keep kosher .
it was my choice .
i was ... crazy ... desperate . i took it out on you . i didn 't mean it . i know what she sees in you . you 're kind and you 're brave . if i ever get out of you , i 'll be glad to call you my friend .
you 're gon na laugh .
... piece of mind .
leaving , now go to sleep . ... all of you .
poor bastard .
whoever took it does .
okay .
... if you are , then i 'll take barbara to soccer and take you to dance after ...
yeah , they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of `` kools '' to the world . `` sealed '' doesn 't hurt scruggs ' litigation , and since we 're the only ones with the story , i believe we 're sitting on an exclusive .
yes , i 'm afraid i did .
if we could take a look , mr. wigand ...
you 're getting ahead of yourself . we 're all in this together . we 're all cbs . we 'll find out soon . thank you , gentlemen .
try the car .
good .
everything interests me .
i did ? what do i tell a source on the next tough story ? hang in with us . you 'll be fine ... maybe ?
that 's good . that works . uh , you know , i want to ask you something ... i know it sounds odd ... but ...
black , black ...
if you want to do it .
good . i want to talk to you .
it 's obvious , isn 't it ?
... they `` volunteered . '' a friend owns a large security company .
no , no . don 't call the police ! just tell him i 'm on the phone with you ... my name is lowell bergman ... just tell him that .
`` the former executive has reason to bet on being sued , for major cigarette manufacturers ... ''
`` there are times ... i wish i hadn 't done it . but there are times that i feel compelled to do it ... '' `` i 've -- if you asked me if i would do it again or if it 's -- do i think it 's worth it . yeah . i think it 's worth it . ''
here . got pictures .
howard !
after you , doll .
yep . my divorce just came through . shoulda called you . coulda cut a better deal ! my wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children . but , i don 't know . guess i 'm just a softie . after all amanda and me were together for -- what -- you 'd know better than me , marylin . she was your best friend .
well -- marylin and rex broke up and ...
mr. dumbarton .
i 'm sorry . that was unkind and -- but , we changed our minds . did you really mean what you said on the phone . it wasn 't because you found out about rex ?
sustained .
so , that 's good , right ?
i don 't know , but don 't call me marylin .
in the godfather , after the courtroom scene , frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub .
i said yes .
isn 't everything ?
`` dismiss your vows , your feigned tears , your flattery , for where a heart is hard , they make no battery . ''
and you 've always loved him ?
yes . why is that so difficult for you to understand ?
absolutely .
although knowing you as i do -- there will be no settlement . this time it will be complete and total annihilation .
yes . short notice you know , but i think there 's nice closure to it . hello judge muson . a pleasure as always .
no . stay . i want you close to me . this couch is wrong . it 's not a `` married couch . ''
i 'm not leaving you . i took self defense
sometimes i forget .
we were about to request the primary residence , and thirty percent of the remaining assets .
thank you , mrs. rexroth .
hello miles .
i want to be exposed .
he tricked you . with a phony wife and a fake pre-nup . howard doyle . he got you . you married marylin , didn 't you ? you thought she had money . ha ha ha . howard doyle made you think that because of what you did to me . and to marylin rexroth . yeah . i heard all about it . my brother howard doyle got you . neener neener neener .
we don 't have much of a relationship anymore . i haven 't seen her since before she married rex . we had some very nice times prior to that . we were quite close .
of course . of course she was married . what else would she be ? single ? i don 't think so .
muriel rumsey .
i don 't want to eat ! and there 's one more thing i don 't want ! definitely ! that 's to see you .
lower the boats !
but the lady says
thanks .
seems to me i 've already thanked you for that . what time is the next bus to new york ?
shut up !
oh , this ? i like privacy when i retire . i 'm very delicate in that respect . prying eyes annoy me . behold the walls of jericho ! [ 4 ] maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet , but a lot safer . you see , i have no trumpet . now just to show you my heart 's in the right place , i 'll give you my best pair of pajamas .
not at all .
when you get up to a hundred , wake me up .
mind your own business .
yeah , swell .
whome ? want to see me ?
yep ! the walls of jericho .
you ain 't gon na stick me for no phone calls . you can go down to the sheriff 's office .
what 's that ?
throw it in the basket . what 's it say ? `` have i got a story ! it 's getting hotter and hotter . hope you 're the same . ''
okay , pete .
hey , you !
al , you can 't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close . goddamn , sam ! if we don 't start reading between the lines here ! y'all got ta start thinking on a different level - like the cia does . we 're through the looking glass . here white is black and black is white .
the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist . they got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture doesn 't even match . i 'm beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castro 's door . if oswald , or someone purporting to be oswald , had gotten into cuba , come back , then killed the president , the american public once again would 've screamed for a cuban invasion ...
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating , and we 'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks . if we call him now , he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we 've ever had .
twenty dollars each time . hell , it 's no secret . that 's what i 'm here for .
the anonymous kind , chief .
no , you 're awake , bill , and i 'm dead serious . and we 're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago . how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day ?
i don 't see any violence , jim . heart attack , maybe an aneurysm . looks like natural causes .
they 're agency , too . don 't you get it ? cia and mafia together . trying to whack out the beard . mutual interests . they been doing it for years . there 's more to this than you dream . fbi fucking hates the cia . navy intelligence got something to do with it too . check out `` alan pope '' in miami . jack youngblood . bill harvey . colonel roselli . the shooter , i hear , was a dallas cop - the bagman at ruby 's club . i heard he shot his own partner . got that ? check out the rich fucks in dallas . h.l . hunt . he 's dirty . that 's all i know . but the agency always runs the show . check out something called `` mongoose '' operation mongoose . government , pentagon stuff , they 're in charge , but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows , fun 'n ' games man - check out southeast asia - that 's the next big number - the heroin trail . `` oh , what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive . ''
fuckin ' a . how do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit ? fuck knows what they got on oswald !
what ?
sure it is . freckle face , if i ever handled a minor felon like that , it 'd be all over the papers . i 'd catch hell . and this is the alleged murderer of the president ?
hi , freckle face .
no , i don 't think i am , susie . anyone else ?
leave us alone for god 's sake ! ... oh , it 's lou .
call me willie . i ain 't got nuthin ' but time , mr. garrison . minutes , hours , days , years of'em . time just stands still here like a snake sunnin ' itself in the road ...
no word yet . but they think it 's in the head .
let 's get outta here , lou . i saw too much stuff like this in the war .
he 's been in trouble before . used to be a hot shot pilot for eastern airlines , but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy .
yeah , guy banister . ex-fbi man . he died couple years ago .
i 've been called everything under the sun , jerry . call me whatever you like .
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain . ferrie handled a lot of the training . there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba . a few americans got trained , too . nazi types . mercenaries . but ferrie was the craziest .
and oswald ?
there was one guy , i don 't know , big guy , business guy , white hair - i saw him come into the office once . he looked out of place , y'know - like a society guy . can 't remember his name . oswald was with him .
it 's a contradiction , numa , get used to them . the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets . or fake secrets .
even your own wife , numa . any of you want to quit , do me a favor ... put us out of our misery .
he 'll never make it . if he wins , they 'll kill him . he wants to avenge his brother . he 'll stop that war . no , they 'll kill him before they let him become president .
yes , thank you , mr. garrison . your coffee 's almost turkish down here but i could get used to it .
splendid , love to see them .
are you kidding , it looks great . you wear this to a business meeting , you 're the badass in the room . but you can go out dancing in this too . it 's a total power suit .
in his inside coat pocket .
every step of this goes in my report . i am now taking a manila envelope from the subject 's flight bag .
sure .
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol , tobacco , and firearms . would you mind if we looked in that bag ?
arrest me .
'course i do -- i deliver money for him .
can you do it or not ?
okay .
who do you think i am ?
in cash .
i am , as a matter of fact .
you went out this morning and bought a gun ?
you went out this morning and bought a gun .
it looks nice .
i got a few . but i can 't afford to start all over again . i got too much time and money invested in my records .
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it , but right now it 's only money .
you 'll get over that .
do you live together ?
then you don 't see him for a few days ?
it isn 't enough for trafficking , but how 'bout posession with the intent to distribute ?
can i smoke ?
you never asked me if i did or not .
that coke was yours , wasn 't it ?
you believe that ? yeah , well , i guess you have to trust him . i 'd have second thoughts on that , but then i know 'em .
i was expecting you . come in .
hey , you get caught with blow , that 's your business .
they told me .
shut your ass up and grab the wall !
way i see it , me and you only got one thing to talk about . what you willing to do for me ?
talk to you tomorrow .
we 're partners , baby , sorta . i ain 't gon na screw you . you haven 't told me where i put it for you .
now that 's over , let 's get to know each other .
so what are you trying to tell me ? i should get out of here ?
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn 't been for your fuckin ' around !
okay , lou-is .
sure . we almost done , ain 't we ?
which one is for the car ?
but you did have a salvation army- thing going .
i told you , man . she my fine little surfer gal .
it 's in there .
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older .
you know it 's for you .
we been shoppin ' . can 't have my boy running around lookin ' like a bum on the street .
you know , i 've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist . nothing penetrates that night . nothing .
he told me he was going to hell .
no . of course you 're not . you 've just hurt your back . that 's all . you 're going to be fine . it 'll just take some time .
save me !
your back ? did you fall ?
goddamn it . i want louis .
gabe .
i don 't believe this . i 'm calling the doctor .
with wings . you transport me , you know that ? you carry me away .
with wings . you transport me , you know that ? you carry me away .
pleasant dreams .
what is wrong with you ?
of course it is . what else could it be ?
no . no . it 's okay . i 'm okay .
punk ?
pause play .
hey cool . they brought ancient hockey guy back to life .
alright , asshole .
yeah yeah i better call the labs , see what the hell is going on .
what do you mean , not enough time ?
what if we blow the walkways first ? leave jason over here to go up with the ship ?
we don 't have a choice !
if we don 't sever the hull completely she 'll drag us down with her .
delongpre ! out of time !
why wouldn 't we be . i mean , look around . so far so good .
rizzo did .
somebody 's gon na have to go back to the engine room .

then stop talking and work faster !
i don 't know !
that 's exactly what we need to find out . check your orders , sergeant . i out rank you where discovery is concerned . now step aside . i have a medical emergency to deal with .
give it a rest yllo . she needs some time .
looks like we 're missing two . stone and kkinsa .
roger that . time to kick some ass !
teach ! where the hell are you ? ! where 's our visuals ? ! !
yeah and he 'll be here soon enough . last chance .
guys ! ! ! the shuttle ?
no you don 't !
yeah , that 's it , scare the hell out of here , that 'll work .
so , you thought you 'd be cool . go against your father 's wishes ? yeah , that 's grown up .
and what happend to ... ?
not so bad .
oh sure , all the time .
i know you .
oh i like her a lot .

she 's obviously dealt with this guy before .
just go ! i 've a feeling he 's right behind us !
well , do something !
shut up , thorgan !
the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve .
then do it . the rescue ship can find us here right ?
i get no kick from champaign , mere alcohol doesn 't faze me at all , but i get a kick out of you .
just get us to the ship !
small brains make your balls itch ?
let 's just get out of here .
so what else is new ?
a little late to be thinking about escape , isn 't it ?
crutch ?
are you crazy ? ! pull the lever !
sergeant , we could use a big bomb .
are there any other shuttles ?
oh shit ! there he is !
come here , might as well fix that arm .
a real mamma 's boy that one . dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum . little good it did him .
he wants to kill you ... and me ... and everyone on this ship .
we just left old earth . you 'll never believe what we found .
jason ? ! where is he ? !
why don 't you get it ? he 's going to kill us all !
4you 're not going anywhere .
you 're crazy !
three ... two ... one ...
it 's okay .
on the swing ? i told you not to play near there until i sanded it down . see what your son did ?
here -- take him home .
... 'cause this is where he lives . you got ta think like they do .
don 't tell me my business ! quarter-mile , that way . full throttle .
what i do is trick him to the surface , got that ? then i can jab him , understand ? think i 'm gon na haul it in as if he 's a catfish , like everyone else does ?
what do we do ? get some help ? radio in ?
we got a barrel on him . we can 't lose him . we stay out here until we find him .
tattoo . had it taken off .
no ! no ! no ! swing around ! after him !
dead astern ! zig-zag !
full throttle ! to port !
he 's taken him !
'cause when we bought the house it was autumn . this is summer . feed the dogs .
ow . he 's got ta be more careful in the water ...
love a cup of tea . with lemon .
excuse me , but what are you talking about ? didn 't they catch the shark this afternoon ? it was on the cape station news .
do i need any more authority ?
be reasonable , boys -- this isn 't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish . ben ... do you have all the pictures you need ?
what kind of a shark did you say it was ?
swell .
let 's all have a drink .
they must 've hit something .
out there is a perfect engine , an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that 's all . look at that ! those proportions are correct . i know sharks .
i wish it would rain ...
this is quite a place .
you were on the indianapolis ? in '45 ? jesus ...
we never had any . what 's the problem ?
looks more like the readers of the national enquirer .
what else could 've done that ?
doctor , you 're the one who told me what it was !
set ?
is anyone having this ... ?
we had a shark attack at south chop this morning , mayor . fatal . got ta batten down the beach .
let me see your hands ...
just a little appetizer . i want our porker to know we 're serving . i want to put some iron into that big yap ...
hell , in the old days we went out with good charts , good sounding lead , and a damn good compass . nowadays , these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders , radar , radio , electric toothbrush , every stupid thing ...
it ain 't a big mac . the expert don 't approve . what do you thing ? you 're closer to the situation .
aye , aye sir . stand by to repel boarders . poop the mainsail . argh , jim boy .
look -- you may be a big yahoo in the lab , but out here you 're just supercargo , and you 'll do as i say , or you can take your gear and backstroke home . now get down here !
25 feet . and three tons of him there .
moray eel . bit right through a wet suit .
nothing ! a pleasure scar . look here --
and i 'll drink to yours .
the shaft is giving .
power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate . if i can hit him . i can kill him . but i got ta be close . very close .
look , maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this , but i 'm not sure ...
i don 't have it .
well , i 'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence . we depend on the summer people for our lives , and if our beaches are closed , then we 're all finished .
yeah . um , i hooked up a whole private adoption thing . these married people in saint cloud are going to be the parents .
well , there we have it . would you like to know the sex ?
i just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here . it 's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in .
it really didn 't hurt that bad having him .
geeeerta rauuuss !
well , i just have the baby and give it to you , right ?
you 're kidding !
i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis . my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises .
yeah . mall madness , huh ?
why ?
most fruitful yuki is bad ass , man . you should be proud to be the same condition .
just , you know , shopping with my girlfriends .
are you kidding ? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly . i 'm like a legend . they call me the cautionary whale .
nothing .
i 'm not crying . i 'm allergic to fine home furnishings . see you later .
which maneuver , sir ? the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another , or the one in which i cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes ?
no , it 's not . paulie is virile , by the way . he was very good in ... chair .
yeah , well , there 's this couple who 've been trying to have a baby for five years .
i have no idea what kind of girl i am .
i don 't know . it 's not ... seasoned yet . wait . huh . yeah , there 's that pink plus sign again . god , it 's unholy .
that is sick , man .
of the penny saver lorings ?
right , seriously .
god , spermy . must you always feed ?
well , you are kind of ... convex .
are you looking for any other compensation ?
she 's hormonal . right , june ? it 's just part of the whole process .
... yeah , sure .
so you don 't do any of those things .
he whips you ?
i haven 't ... i 'm a fast learner .
how 'd you meet early ?
you can ?
almost .
i heard that .
yeah i left him with the car ... we 're all squared up now .
go back to the car and keep brian there . i don 't want him in here ... do it adele ... now !
it 's chinese food . it was the only place open . you said you was starving , you 'd eat anyth ...
i don 't know , they didn 't speak too good english .
early ! stop ! !
what do you need a bible for ?
oh ... i do some work up at the merrick mirror factory , or i used to ...
he almost always killed strangers . spent years moving on from one place to another . that made it real hard to track him down .
... ha .
two brothers , prospectors , lived here . up until a few years back .
thank god !
the party ?
it was definitely the high point of the evening .
mmm ... i love it when you talk like that .
real polite . kept calling me 'sir . '
lighten up ...
hey , i got some great stuff ... it 's okay .
you sure been acting like you were ... ... out whoopin ' it up , a drankin ' and ever ' thang .
listen , eric 's been `` finishing '' his for over three years now .

... brian hurt his foot .
everybody just shut up !
... i know i 'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face .
man i haven 't seen her in forever . what the fuck 's she up to ?
he looks like my uncle .
yeah .
shut the fuck up .
i don 't know . how much do you want ?
fifteen for me .
yeah probably .
naw . but we should run by the park and get a dime . maybe darcy will be at the park .
is it cold ?
no .
foreplay . foreplay .
whah you say ? dissdee ?
it 's like yeah whatever . but when you fuck . you wan na fuck that person . you 're like ripping each other 's hair out . ooooh .
have you ever swallowed it before ?
oh god . that 's horrible .
no .
maybe you should .
you don 't have an investigation without me . you got that ?
homesearchers .
what ?
sit down !
what was your relationship with her ?
i 'm sorry , this is just too convenient .
yeah , i am . i think he 's playing us . if i was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me , what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else ?
but a hundred men could move him .
he was with me ?
you told me . when you called you said she was in the other room . drop the knife .
fuck off !
thanks , david .
bingo .
call dispatch . double the patrols . i want that area blanketed .
peter 's right , captain . he 's got to be forced into making a mistake .
that 's a big area to cover .
about a quarter to one .
what does that mean ?
you know , i hate to say i told you so , but i warned her . coming home at all hours of the night . a young girl new to the city . this neighborhood ain 't what it used to be .
i don 't know . i was afraid there 'd be hours of questions . i can 't afford to miss a game .
that 's alright . we 'll take it from here .
`` is '' . did you tell him about the institute ?
but he had to dump the body there to make the move .
i signed the confession . what about the car ?
you don 't win by playing it safe , peter .
it 's alright .
yes .
getting too hot in here for you ?
i don 't think i could .
then show me who you are .
-- admit what ? that i was right about you in the steam room ? that you 're willing to do anything to find out what you want ? would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room ?
he didn 't tell you either .
of course not .
never mind my ears ! go away !
in a great fortress in the mountains . wait . something 's happening .
everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death .
he thinks you betray him with lyssa . colwyn ! the waters deceive you !
he sees betrayal everywhere . he will attack us so long as he is conscious .
where the spiral begins .
what will happen ?
he saved our lives .
i 'm all right .
why do they burn the villages ? there 's nothing to gain .
those are not child 's tear . a child cries for himself , a man cries for those he loves .
i knew you would not be . that 's why i chose you .
they do not exist , except in the waters of the swamp , where they will remain .
those beasts can not be saddled by mortal men .
at the gallop !
first , you desert me , and now you mock me . go back to your one-eyed friend .
and do you think i 'm not going to eat myself to death this very night ? huh ?
get me down from here you louts or i 'll turn you all into pigs !
hush !
no . he will master the leader .
you know nothing of power , you foolish girl . you think power is a mighty sword , or a strong castle , or the paltry magic of an emerald seer . power is none of these .
then look !
they will fail for , during the day , the power of the circle is greater than theirs . only at night can they pierce the circle .
there 's an emerald circle a few leagues from here . we 'll find her .
yes . like you , a king . a king of many worlds . all enslaved .
each to his fate . wait for me at the inn . if i am not back by dawn , you will know my fate , and you must go on without me .
it 's a hundred leagues from here .
it is not necessary . they will not follow .
i 'll explain you , leon : they 'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can 't write and they 'll ask you your job , your employer 's name and you can 't tell them : my job , i 'm a hitman and my employer is tony , his record is longer than his resturant 's menu . that 's why you can 't have a bank account !
perfect .
yes , yes ...
ok .
yes .
... this is what i don 't like , you see : you don 't refrain me , but at the same time i can 't get out !
i never rent my gear .
and ... may i kiss you , like in the movies , may this be an exception ?
mathilda , stop , please !
huh , really ? what ? come on , i 'm waiting !
... yes . the day he got out of jail . i allowed him to make ten steps ... no more . and bang . two hundred meters . by telescope . that night , i left my country and came here , to join my father , who worked for tony . ... i was 17 . then , i never left the city ... and never had another girlfriend ...
let me work . we 'll get out , i tell you !
not at all , mathilda ! i tell you because it 's true ! you 'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose , ok ? we 'll go where you want ! i swear , you 'll see , mathilda ! !
high-top nike cross-trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles . they 're nasty .
how serious is it ?
you need a ride , preacher ?
it 's just a regular day .
well , i 'm sure it 's not christmas , because you 'd be worried about how much money we don 't have to spend on each other ... i know it 's not new years , because you 'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don 't like to dance ... and i 'm sure it 's not our anniversary , because i didn 't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says , 'pick out something pretty ' ... yes -- maurice -- i 'm virtually certain it 's not a special day today .
please tell me .
don 't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases .
good .
i 'm not proving to her . i 'm showing her . and i know i don 't have to . i want to . i 've realized , love is about giving . i 'm alive , i can still give to her . i want to give her everything i can .
maurice and ellen parker ... it was issued in philly ... mr. maurice parker has come a long way from home . why ?
maybe .
i always knew you had good instincts ... goodbye kris . i 'll see you when i get back .
i said , 'i would do anything for her ' ... and she didn 't believe me . i said , 'i 'd walk across the country for her ' ... she didn 't believe me .
so i 've been informed .
i was thinking you could open another store with investors . i 'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now .
no more words . until i touch the ocean with my hands ... it 's all just words .
oh , that 's not mine .
forty-seven years .
yes .
that 's funny . i wonder if you 'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me ?
of course .
i don 't care about that . there 's time left . you can have more money . you can drink all you want . you can talk or listen . just stay , that 's all i want .
don 't be silly ?
what ?
do you want to go gambling tonight ? we could go out and play for a few hours .
then come . i 'm going to change . watch tv . i 'll be half an hour .
yes .
like i said ... it was a slow night ... i 'm sorry . it was hard to score .
no .
who could better understand than me ?
yes . i was washing my hair .
that 's touching , elle , but we need an alibi .
thank you !
yes , i am .
but you agreed last night . in the office ? when we were discussing my `` career '' ?
oh , yes . mrs. windham is the most sweet , wonderful woman i know . i have loved her since the day she hired me . she could never do something this awful . i know this because we are very close .
see ?
hell , yes . we 've got finals to study for . in jamaica .
why else would he be taking you to the ivy ? you 've been dating for a year -- it 's not like he 's trying to impress you .
thank you . i love you , too .
margot !
not yet .
my money 's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife .
no , she can 't move for an hour .
for a butt-head ? yes .
what ? !
gay men know designers . straight men don 't .
helloo ... he just had lunch with his grandmother . you know he got `` the rock '' .
i just don 't understand what went wrong --
what , like on va-kay ?
absolutely !
we 're on our way to the bridal show in new york so we thought we 'd rescue you from law school for the night .
i can 't believe you 're a laker girl !
she was a delta gamma ! not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me . but i used to take her class at the la sports club . she 's amazing !
of course , i do !
uh -- sure .
fine . except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my civ pro professor . but no biggie . you 're here now . how was your summer ?
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school . we got back together over the summer at my grandmother 's birthday party .
really ?
cunnilingus ?
wait -- cecil has a condo in tahoe . let 's go there !
yeah , luckily .
i have something far more pleasant awaiting me .
too bad your precious jack can 't hear you ... the damsel in distress ... a rescue attempt would be most amusing ... we could flay sweet jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment ...
no more listening ! your time is at an end , insignificant whelp !
dance , jack ! the night 's but begun .
better we eat him than the other way round .
stoutly spoke , lad . these dwarves be sore grouches ... pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling .
be gentle with them , jack . they only march to please you . were this a faerie journey , we 'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems .
it bodes evil .
stay on your guard , jack . the bug is enchanted surely .
but seem to have gotten lost on the way .
the chill is worse this night .
it 's your own fear troubles you ... we 're here , aren 't we ? for all the dark magic protecting it .
patience , lad .
ah , but you will . and so will the baron , when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway .
tis a delicate operation , lad . requires a bit of engineering ... next !
sapphire !
wolf-slayer , worm-sticker ... give a cheer for the champion !
no , no , no ... this is different !
screwball ! be quiet ... ! we have friends live 'neath the needle . they 'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night .
gon na make ogre-stew !
very thrifty . even got your arrow back .
you 'll do it because i am you liege and i command you to do it !
oh , jack , you are a wild man to use me so .
whilst you were sleeping , i fetched your ring .
sorry .
no fear of that now .
watch behind or i 'll never collect on it !
of course they 're alive . all nature is living .
his honor , i suppose ... seeing he no longer can defend it .
bah ! you faeries have the morals of ferrets .
no speeches ! what 's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres ?
i slew the lindfarne worm with it .
sigurd the volsung slew fafnir with that blade ... see the line where regin welded the break ?
may god protect you .
i 'm sending you back to hell !
yes , yes ... jimmy squarefoot good friend to one and all ...
you follow .
i thought i might stop by .
since seventh grade .
it 's so beautiful .
i don 't think dad wants you home .
uh ... using josh like that .
i 'd be more comfortable if you hadn 't slept with josh . and george would be more comfortable if he weren 't dying .
i 'll survive .
i 'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer , i 've decided .
his parents took his car . they 're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer .
are you afraid of heights ?
what ?
he 's got a standing invitation .
george just never really ... aimed that high . even with not hitting a rabbit . i knew you were doing that , by the way . that 's why i stopped doing it with you . you were no fun . it was always like you were frightened . quiet and boring .
he builds models for architects . his dad , on the other hand , was the real deal . designed and built the coolest houses i 've ever seen .
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered .
i flushed it down the toilet .
if that 's what it takes .
i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead .
thanks , i 'd like that . thank you .
and you thought they might be under her dress ?
no i 'm not !
you have everything ?
the game was to make me smaller than he was . no matter what . he could be almost invisible as a human being , but i had to be smaller . so if i got good grades , i was a pussy for not playing football . if i cut my hair for him , it wasn 't short enough . if i shaved it , i looked like a psycho . i never won the game . not once . and if he couldn 't make me smaller with words ...
here .
good for you .
i haven 't forced him to work . i only wet him down once . why would he leave ?
i don 't let him . he just loves to .
three .
you let him pierce his nose ?
let 's go .
well , for later then .
sam 's favorite .
the antibiotics weren 't working . it 's what i believe , george .
hindsight . it 's like foresight without a future .
you 're not well .
my stupid back .
oh , i 'm worse . much , much worse .
it 's not my back that 's killing me .
not a perfect day .
i could use the money .
do you remember anything i 've said that wasn 't negative ?
sooner than the fall .
lois will stay with them . or we can pawn them off on your parents .
i know .
are you wearing eye shadow ?
either do you .
i just thought it would be nice .
can we really help build a house ?
someone stop her !
goodnight , claude .
here !
but i 'm having a good time ...
good old monroe .
hell with him then . if he can 't share the driving , he can 't ride in the truck .
shut up . it 's too damn hot . what do you know , anyway ?
what about you , radio ?
wait up there , claude . you give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you 'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails .
i 'm stuck !
i 'm sick of watching camp 12 win the championship . every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick . this year i want that pig .
don 't matter who camp 12 puts on the mound . all i know is when this season 's over camp 8 's gon na have pork chops .
we 're like his handlers . he can 't function without us .
let me see that .
make 'em throw strikes .
don 't touch that car .
no , believe me , i 'm gon na kill him !
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth .
hell of a day , ray . yankees are on fire .
i 'm sorry , he 's on medication ...
i try to moisturize regularly .
you killed santa claus ?
why ain 't that pick swinging ?
new york . that 's up north , ain 't it ? they 'll find we do things different down here .
that 's right . we don 't need no fences , we have the gun line . it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard . you are now inside the gun line ...
my corn bread ? oh no , my friend . i love corn bread .
c'mon , goldmouth , somebody 's got ta watch the front door .
come on , old-timer , hook the brothers up .
what happened to 'em after that , willie ?
i think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago . come on , let 's get this over with .
don 't argue with me . you need it more than i do . i know how a little money can help in a place like this .
do you realize what your saying , gibson ?
what difference does it make ? natchez was better off without winston hancock ! who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing ? at least the state of mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal !
like you shot winston hancock ?
greenville , that the nearest town ?
sure i 've been to the cotton club . it 's pretty sweet . but it don 't hold a candle to the boom boom room . that 's where the real action is .
that 's my joint . the swinginest nightclub in town .
i 'm talking about old satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint .
you found him .
puerto rican rum . see for yourself .
all i need is the front money and a truck . i could be back in two , three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving .
absolutely not .
i 've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years .
yeah , get out of here ! beat it !
noon ...
sure , why not ?
try four and a half . at first i totally didn 't like him .
show him central park .
i would totally love to go there . but i hear it 's really hard to get in .
maybe try the opposite of that .
well , she was about six-three , only spoke portuguese and had really long grey hair .
angels don 't get any older , son .
it was a long time ago , at some heaven and hell mixer .
trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on earth .
he 'll be here . just keep your cool , kid .
that turn you on there , rupaul ?
put it in your mouth .
great . now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the upper east side . but i misplaced it .
i think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects . now i 'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown .
the shit has hit the fan , kid . take a look .
now he 's got no ears ! you happy , nicky ? your father 's got no ears !
cassius , didn 't i tell you to stay out of your brother 's mind ?
and i also happen to be a jets fan .
son , just do your best .
we got ta get this bad boy burning again . ideas ?
i got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal .
i got ta say this cake tastes a little funny .
of course you do , tommy tune .
'bout time ...
the dark prince is here .
six , six , six , pick up sticks .
we 're going to see ozzy play at the meadowlands , right now . wan na come , nicky ?
little nervous . wan na puke .
absolutely nothing . the blizzard always came straight with his messages . but wrap your minds around this one .
not again , fellas . it kind of hurts .
oh . sorry , andrew . valerie ?
i 'm not sure , but it didn 't involve getting blinded with poison .
okay , i do . get back up here .
next time . tonight , i want to share the most beautiful thing i could possibly imagine .
from my dad 's side of the family .
why ? did she hurt you ? do you miss her ? need a shoulder to cry on ?
no , for you ! how old are you , billy ?
anything to eat ?
you walked in . i saw you . don 't you remember ?
where do we go ? ! where do we go from here ? ? ! !
only a few ? you 're just not trying .
yes . but you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing , wondering ?
what do you need ?
that 's nice .
why , jessica ? you 're still a green .
it 's the only way .
we 'll be all right ... we will ...
why don 't we rest here ? we know we can eat these .
do you think he was telling the truth ?
thirty thousand years didn 't last very long , did they ?
`` beloved husband '' . `` beloved wife '' . what can all that mean ?
we 'll remember . but that 's a long time off ...
of course you can stay . this belongs to the people .
alive ?
sure , i 'm okay .
no . fred hates them .
i don 't know if i want to stay here . i don 't feel safe .
anybody else have a key to the house .
or not so recently ?
yeah .
over there .
dick can 't be dead . who told you he was dead ?
do ya good .
are you hungry , honey ? i 'll fix you something .
you came home . your friend sheila brought you here .
nothing , marsh . vanished . there 's an apb out on him . his photo 's been faxed nationwide .
what 's the word on the street ?
we 'll get a tail put on him .
i 'm not entirely certain , captain . you 'll have to see for yourself .
pete , what happened to you ?
coming up .
the first night ... not the last two .
maybe .
yes , i just found it on the step .
i guess so .
all right .
i wish i knew .
but that doesn 't solve the problem . who is doing this ? and why ?
just a minute .
sorry ... i ...
i do like you , sheila .
come on .
let me have it . `` aboard the s.s. manchuria . last night conway seemed to recover his memory . kept talking about shangri- la , telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet . insisted upon returning there at once . locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore . am leaving ship myself to overtake him , as fearful of his condition . wrote down details of conway 's story about shangri-la which i am forwarding . lord gainsford . ''
she 's remaining in her room . she isn 't feeling very well . now please go on without me . i eat very little .
thank you .
yes . those are our own people . they never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning . it is much too hazardous .
of course . that 's what i told them last night . you can 't expect a man to sail around in the dark . [ 5 ] during this george has been looking around - he rises .
do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots ?
i just feel as though i 'm being made ready for the executioner .
mr. conway , i don 't like this place . i don 't like it . it 's too mysterious .
plumbing . everything modern . i 'm going to run pipes all through the village
wonder what 's happened to fenner .
well , there 's nothing we can do until the morning .
i 'll say .
please ! please ! do not wait for me ! i eat so very little .
all right , i will ! i 'll let my hair down ! why not ? it can 't make any real difference now . hey lovey , were you ever chased by the police ?
mr. chang - high lamas or low lamas , do we get the porters ?
we follow many .
well , we 've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years .
pardon me
don 't believe him , bob . he 's just trying to get out .
no , mr. conway , i 'm not lying . what reason could i have for lying ? the chances are that we 'll never come out of that horrible trip alive , but i 'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive , than to stay here one more minute now .
personally , i 've enjoyed your community very much . but my friends do not care for this mystery . they are determined to leave as soon as
come on ! quick ! this way .
i 'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is .
it looks like it . smell those fumes ?
let me go , bob !
all right . sorry , george .
as long as they keep on aiming at us , we 're safe . come now , child .
we 'd be eternally grateful if you
don 't worry about the pigeons . from now on , you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet !
how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head ! right over my head . oh , my word ! i tell you , those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction . i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape .
i don 't know . i 'm a paleontologist , not a foreign secretary .
english !
it 's not even a fucking door .
oh , you 'll still , be guarding him .
i ... i don 't know , air . this guy . mr. `` best of the best of the best ... `` i don 't know . it 's just still find it a little ... humorous . i 'm sorry . sir .
what happens if i say no ?
don 't worry about it . it 's been a long night . speaking of which -- you owe me a cup of coffee , remember ?
yup . sure is .
kay ...
i understand . hey , it works for the hasids , right ? no one recognizes them .
the pentagon .
for how long ?
i 'd double it and add 20 .
you know , there 's something we never really thought of ...
actually , they disgust me . but that 's what i love about them . like a car wrack , you know , how you shouldn 't look , but you always pull over and watch real close , or even pretend you 're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures ?
out of focus ?
i understand . i understand , thank you . -- how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser ?
you 're not taking me in !
the what ?
wait -- listen --
so whattya say , kid ? you in or out ?
oh , jesus ...
how can i do what i do now ? let 's just say i spent a lot of time in the prison library .
beauty ? the precogs don 't even always agree with each other !
red ball -- double homicide : one male , one female . killer 's male , white , 40 's .
we 're in motion on something .
that was easy .
it could have been a nightmare ... sometimes they dream about the old murders .
there 's no way of knowing for sure . she could 've forgotten whatever it is you 're looking for ...
i guess that 's all of it .
i love you , too ! i love you daddy . love ya , dad .
no !
no .
who said i would ?
i 'll be right there .
thank you . this is burgess .

i ain 't drinking hot piss with you . come on , sam .
you putting a hurtin ' on my vision .
let it burn . maybe you 'll hear me then .
soiled with dirt , foul ; sullen , hostile , forbidding -- as a black day . foully or outrageously wicked , as black cruelty . indicating disgrace , dishonor or culpability .
the first men on earth were black . they ruled and there was not one white face anywhere . but they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees . black men were never like that .
who are you ?
mr. x , i was out there tonight . i saw what you did . i want to be a muslim . i ain 't never seen a negro stand up to the police like that .
preacher , take your tin jesus and the virgin mary , both , and shove 'em .
women are deceitful . they are untrustworthy flesh . i 've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women .
now you come back .
what for ? i ain 't white and i don 't put out .
please make way , please --
... that isn 't a whore ?
c'mere .

yeah .
jesus christ , homey , you are nuts .
what can you do ?
jesus christ , no . okay , okay . you got it , you got it ! you 're the boss .
all these photos you just saw were of policemen . sadly they 're protected . la hermanidad . the brotherhood .
off the top of my head , i don 't know what they could 've been .
i have connections .
[ aurillio rosas sanchez . ]
[ everything on the cellphone . we wait for calls . we have no number to call . ]
[ it 's all up to you , commandante . tell me about you and 'the dreamer ' . ]
you got tossed . don 't trust the cops , especially the judicials . oh you know that ?
i 'll get you up to the border . friend of mine 'll take you in to san diego . drop you right at the hospital .
that 's right .
i go to school , don 't i ?
they can stay for two weeks . i don 't care .
my ankle .
you need to practice .
there 's no such thing as tough . you 're either trained or untrained .
frank . frankie .
never .
because ... i was already dead .
i 'm trying , mom .
we 'll see . and thank your father in the morning . a man always needs to be thanked .
you 're going to miss mexican halloween . the day of the dead .
do you have any family , mr. creasy ?
he has to go .
[ creasy is not a policeman . my sense is he could be very valuable to us . ]
[ it 's a moral issue . on one hand you 're cleaning up the bad guys , but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys . ]
i don 't know . what do you feel like doing ?
where you going ?
she musta kept you inna shadows all night .
come on over about half past seven , we 'll think of something . hello , ma , what 's the matter ?
i came to see you . how you feel ?
i 'm thirty-four .
i really should get home , i told my father ... well , i suppose a little while longer . i wonder if there 's any place around here i could put some makeup on ...
nothing .
okay .
well , at the time she told me this , she already had six . every time i saw the woman , she was either ...
sure , great if you ain 't married .
sure ! sure ! it 's gon na be nice ! it 's gon na be nice ! i 'll come over tonight to your house , and i talk with catherine , and you see , everything is gon na work out all right .
i don 't know , ma . i 'm all knocked out . i may just hang arounna house .
we just got here about fifteen minutes ago . ma , i want you to meet miss clara snyder . she 's graduate of new york university . she teaches chemistry in benjamin franklin high school .
i offered her , ma , she don 't want nothing .
sure .
i don 't know . i don 't think so .
she didn 't look italian to me .
i don 't know , ma . i 'm all knocked out . i think i 'll just hang arounna house and watch ...
she 's right . she 's right . young husband and wife , they should have their own home . and my sister catherine , she 's my sister , but i got ta admit , she 's an old goat . and plenty-a times in my life , i feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself . and i tell you now , as far as i 'm concerned , if catherine wantsa come live here with me and marty , it 's all right with me .
oh , marty , thanks a lot . that really takes a load offa my mind .
hey , why don 't you go to the movie ? your mother and me , we 're gon na be baby-sitter .
how 's marty been lately , aunt theresa ?
well , sure , but i 'm also worried about walt waldowski painless . his poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling , and he said what difference did it make , it was just a card game .
he 'll live if that 's what you mean . but somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there 's nothing left between his legs .
you fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day ? the union ain 't gon na like it .
sure , you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake .
pour one for painless .
no , ho-jon , we 're not going to open you up .
i don 't drink intoxicants .
... no cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight . from evil . for thine is the kingdom , the power and ...
and get ourselves another touchdown to win . i wish to hell we knew what they were plotting .
shore patrol , duke . let 's go !
i done my shopping in seoul last night .
the spot we picked to spend the winter . maybe we ought to look a little harder .
finest kind . we 'll sit where we can get the best view .
that 's right , pal . you just sit up front and sign the mail , and leave the cutting to us .
we been had .
we sure don 't aim to cause any trouble ... yeah , she seems to grow on you .
all three of us played for our schools . and there are at least four other guys ...
i worked with spearchucker my first month over here , at the 72nd evac in taegu . most of the colored guys know who he is but they 're not talking because he asked them not to .
i don 't think i could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer .
same here . you can retire my number .
if you don 't know what you 've seen , why should i ?
part of him . painless is the owner and operator of the pride of hamtrack . that 's where he comes from ... hamtrack , michigan .
ho-jon , give the father some more martini .
the painless pole plans to cross the great divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out .
you want it straight ? medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving .
'course it isn 't , but how many chances do we get to go to japan ? with our golf clubs .
radar !
they 're coming .
we can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer . henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for dr. oliver harmon jones .
honey , nobody as pretty as you could ever impose ... please sit down . coffee ?
save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home .
i 'm too busy , actually . not for the army , of course , but where i live . dr. yamachi 's new era pediatric hospital and whorehouse . i 'm serious . the guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it , all in the same building .
that 's about the only thing i don 't do that i 'm built for . i inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital . sometimes i tend bar and act as bouncer .
well , i 'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces .
you guys got any black capsules ?
big day . two jaws to rebuild .
right , ho-jon . see you later .
finest kind . captain forrests say you better haul ass home quick . we got new chest-cutter in our tent .
nope , we 're assigned heah .
that 's all the commitment you 're offering me ? or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation ?
now i 'll have to wait at least a week . if i announced it tomorrow , after what our new chief nurse saw this afternoon , they 'd hear her yelling from seoul to washington .
it 's the only way we can make enough to put ho-jon through androscoggin .
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident . we try to remember we 're a military organization .
i can try , sir .
good morning .
may i have the surgeon 's name , please ?
now ?
yeah , maybe .
oh , i get the idea . yeah , maybe .
never mind . let him alone . he 's all right . i 'll be right over there pulling for you .
no .
john , please let me go with you ! please , john !
all right , but present it to him as a great cause for the common man .
no , no , nothat 's your seat .
look , mr. connell . . . i just can 't afford to be without work right now , not even for a day . i 've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
sorry .
no , no , no ! you can 't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard !
that 's
her old man was doc mitchell . you know , the doc that saved my mother 's life and wouldn 't take any money for it ? you remember that ? okay , boss , i 'll go and look for her .

you betcha .
no , no , no , the gal 's right . we can 't let the chronicle get the laugh on us ! we 've got to produce a john doe now . amateur journalism , huh ! i 'll show those guys .
okay , beany , bring 'em in one at a time . wipe to : montage : half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ann shakes her head , negatively .
no , i didn 't .
well , the paper said there were some jobs around loose . thought there might be one left over .
thanks .
yes , of course . i 'll see that she gets the flowers .
good night , john .
well , that 's a cinch . i know somebody that 'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth .
feller runs the chronicle . here 's the speech you makeand it 's all written out for you .
may i come in ? i would just like to ask you a couple of questions .
of course .
so that we could get the best price . he 's got respect for you . he 's gon na try to lowball me , mike .
they want walter dead !
huh ?
yes , i do . that way there 's no misunderstandings . i need to make sure no one 's hurt , then we can take care of business .
good . i won 't be armed . we got ta operate on trust here . we 're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible .
what if you and me got into a struggle ... and my gun went off ?
if you say so .
a little exercise in lateral thinking . the obvious solution isn 't always the only solution ... see you tomorrow .
we could fill it with water .
not the ones i 'm at .
i don 't gamble .
i think so .
okay , stop .
you 're a compulsive gambler ?
i do .
fine .
he 'll be running at the quarter pole .
yeah , first and second .
you don 't know shit , and i suggest you leave .
oh , i 've got to get a shot of this .
use your imagination .
i think i 'll stand out here in the sun .
yeah , i could get used to this paradise shit .
i 'm en route . e.t.a . in five .
he says , `` thank you very much . '' i 'll discuss it with him right now ... good-bye , chief .
no , she said she had a son . in a dream she once called life .
if you could meet god , what would you say to him ?
true . but why ?
yes ...
yes , so which one of us does that make the coward ?
but have them wait for me 'till they move in on him .
-- he won 't .
-- yes .
go !
tanner .
no .
who are you ? !
of course you do . and the only shot you 've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program .
of course you do . and the only shot you 've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program .
-- transmit now !
if we don 't try , zordon won 't survive !
the only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being ...
stylin ' !
outside of his time warp he 's aging at a vastly acellerated rate !
there should be a way to open it .
i 've got it ! we use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself ! !
activating power beam !
what does that mean ? !
don 't lose hope yet , alpha !
i am the crane , agile and sublime !
we 've got ten triacs before we 're toast ! !
we can take these guys !
give it everything we 've got !
there 's the comet !
ultra ninja megazord complete !
ditto for the swooping swallow .
be the swallow . be the swallow ...
there 's enough for everybody !
if we told you -- we 'd have to kill you .
by learning the ancient art of ninjetti . it is the genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the ninja . it is the perfect union of mind , body and spirit .
the legend goes that you release the power with the power .
couldn '' t stand them -- low-class all the way . and did you catch a whiff of their breath ? ! it 's like having a conversation with a couple of onions ! not to mention ...
yes , well , i suppose you 'd know a little something about that . not to worry . i 'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils ! and what better way to entice them ... than with a little ivan 's ooze ? !
ah , the old and doddering . i 'm going to scourge their puny minds , reducing them to zombie 's . and then i 'll put them to work rebuilding my empire .
go ivan ! !
you know boss , i 'd really like to help out but i 've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave --
well , if i did i certainly wouldn 't say it to you !
go power rangers !
strength in numbers ! !
the bismark in chicago . you familiar ?
since colosimo bit it , i got ta keep an eye out for his friends .
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions .
mr. rothstein , can i be frank ? you 're a gambler , and i know you 've had losses . i also know you could sell to maranzano or masseria for fifty g 's , but nobody sells to those guys once . so if ya really got another buyer , and ya wan na welch , i ain 't gon na beef .
i can not bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more .
can 't we get a couple whores over ?
which is why he doesn 't need us .
long as charlie says .
that ain 't what your mama said .
ya ignorant guinea , it 's kreplach .
what are ya thinkin ' , charlie ?
it always is .
it 'll all be over tomorrow . no more wars . no more killin ' . just livin ' normal like everybody else . you 'll be stuck with me for good .
and maybe that 's why he ended up dead in the streets of rome .
i told you twenty !
come on . tell us , shitface .
they don 't give a shit about us !
yeah . yeah . i bet ya feed maranzano that same line .
calculated risks . but boss , this one don 't calculate .
look at this boy . he hardly eats . like that fella killed caesar .
don , i 'd be honored .
the name 's charlie .
i 'll take care of the boss .
no matter what you say to me salvatore , you are my bambino .
i turned him down flat .
we can 't sell out to those guys . they ain 't businessmen !
if it comes to that . yeah .
just wanted ta say hello .
oh , poor buster . he hasn 't been fed in a day and a half . let me get some food ...
sad commentary , huh ?
home sweet home , huh ? actually , i was expecting something a little swankier . how much loot does old stu rake in , anyway ?
i 'd better go report this ...
it was great , baby . let 's get you to the er .
baby ... you 're asking the wrong guy .
is something wrong , stu ? you seem so tense .
no . goodbye . thanks for nothing .
mm hmm .
oh . you need a cappuccino .
yes , sir . all right , boys -- let 's go .
what for ? why , suppose there 's a storm -- all lines are down -- how you gon na get a message to ma ?
i 'll brain that guy ! well -- call paine -- call saunders --
i give that trail blazer five more minutes to show up -- -- *five more minutes* !
whadaya mean -- *right* ?
who ?
right now -- everything i own -- !
nonsense .
jim -- if i fling a party man like horace in the face of those angry committees --
jim -- the answer to a prayer -- manna from heaven -- the man *we want* -- and the votes *we need* --
i said , sir -- in my official capacity -- as an honorary gesture -- i appoint you to the united states senate !
is *what* getting me down ?
oh , a *boy* !
uh -- could -- could i help -- ?
i beg your pardon ?
when jeff gets through with taylor -- quiet ! what do you mean by breaking in here -- ? get out ! get *out* of here !
well , that ends that crisis . this way , senator .
mr. president --
the gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his state . he has been waiting , as he so fancifully puts it , for them to come marching here in droves . would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say ?
mr. president , have i permission to bring into this chamber evidence of the response from my state ?
well -- i 'll go to halifax !
now , now , now ! it 's all right , governor .
what ?
i -- i don 't know . i -- i 'm afraid they 've got me licked .
not *me* ! joseph paine is the man they ought to be listening to ! come on !
the senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered !
i -- i 'm sorry , sir . i -- i have a bill --
yes , sir --
why , he 's a senator , isn 't he ? i 'm surprised at you , mister mcgann --
fine thing jim taylor wished on me -- show him the monuments -- i need this job like i need ten pounds .
jeff -- meet mr. cook and mr. griffith -- members of our state headquarters here .
what 's the matter ?
yes -- a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading . so calm down , chick -- and -- goodnight .
shut up ! you 've *got* the man pilloried ! do you have to dance around him like a cannibal -- !
no -- i -- i 'll take a walk --
i don 't care to meet anybody until i get paid -- come on -- come on . one dollar each , please , for the milk fund .
will senator smith yield to -- ?
will senator smith yield to his colleague ?
page boys !
who are you ?
that 's very nice of mr. cobb - but i don 't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what .
some people like it .
yes , you own it .
always .
uh-huh .
would you like to go for a walk ?
no !
really ?
yeah , i guess so . what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other . why don 't they try liking each other once in a while ?
no - not at all . i couldn 't sleep either .
i 'll get my hat .
yes , of course .
nothing .
we 're not going out tonight .
babe ought to get him drunk again .
shhh !
come on - let 's go !
yes , sir .
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip .
no , we won 't ! the next time that jumping jack comes out , i 'll straddle him while you ask him your questions .
all right .
who - me ? no .
how can he make any trouble for me ? i haven 't done anything .
yes , indeed . i wonder why he left me all that money ? i don 't need it .
i don 't think we 've got any suitcases .
well , then , we must give the wrong kind of shows .
well , thanks , i - uh how do you do ? what is your name ?
you 'll excuse me , won 't you ? i 'll be right back .
and don 't ever get down on your knees again , understand ?
why , you must drink ! all poets drink !
mr. morrow , over there , for instance , just dashes them off .
well , i play the tuba .
oh , yes . yes . about my throwing those people out of my house . mrs. pomponi told the truth . i did throw them out because i didn 't want the party in the first place . i didn 't invite anybody . mrs. pomponi did all that . they just came to see what kind of a freak the `` cinderella man '' was . i don 't know how people like that are supposed to act , your honor , but if that pomponi woman is an example , i 'll stick to simple folks . she just came in , talked my ear off , and took charge of everything . if i were a friend of hers , i 'd have her examined .
personally , i don 't know what mr. cedar 's raving about . from what i can see , no matter what system of government we have , there will always be leaders and always be followers .
of course they 're going to stay . she 's got some fresh orange layer cake . you know , with the thick stuff on the top ? sure , they don 't want to go to the hotel .
i don 't care how much it is . you sit right there and eat your lunch . you haven 't touched a thing .
sure . they got on my nerves , so i threw 'em out .
thank you so much . good night .
what , sir ?
yes , sir .
no ! what do you want ! !
`` there 's no shame in getting a little therapy '' , right , doc ?
no , dr. delbanco , it is i who am sorry . sorry to have wasted your time with such ...
right now ?
dorothy fowler . fantastic woman . she passed last year in a train wreck . damned amtrak .
my approach ?
me too , doc . and i can 't tell you what that package meant to me --
my name 's gilroy . i 'm from the state certification board .
nope .
she seems very unhappy .
doc . ainge ...
it 's a pleasure to meet you .
too bad . that 's tough , i mean it . i 'm not unsympathetic . but skip says you 're in love .
come out this way . there 's no shame in getting a little therapy ... is there , althea ?
and it 's the hubble telescope , not the himball telescope .
thanks for your help , lionel .
mumford ... like the town ?
mother ... go away !
-- the problem is you 're a big fake . you haven 't got a clue what 's wrong with that girl .
well , i got ta say , mrs. cook , you 're right about that .
i 'd better not , i 'll fall right to sleep . i think it 's too soon for me to be sleeping with you .
oh , lord . it 's almost too exhausting to tell you ... ... about my exhaustion . i didn 't really want to come . i 'm not hopeful right now . but i couldn 't take the look on my dad 's face . he 's a truly kind person , which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story . he 's the opposite of me , i guess -- all stamina and resolve .
about six months ago , i guess it is now . god , it seems like years . what a bore ! i 'm embarrassed by it . before this happened -- when i 'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit .
no , that 'd be a good story , but that was just the beginning of the end . we went on for another year or so .
of course .
first off , he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes . i told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no . as you can see --
are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
everything flows from that , and what doesn 't ... can be easily purchased .
see you thursday ... regular time .
you want my advice ? far out !
what ?
yes . to hamunaptra . to perform the ritual .
priests . imhotep 's priests .
did you say 'kill ' my sister ?
shut-up and gim me your bandolier .
in the desert ? what for ?
why if it ain 't my little buddy , beni . i oughta kill you .
even ?
sounds familiar .
hey beni ! looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river !
i 've had worse .
that 's one way of putting it .
when ramesses destroyed syria , it was an accident . you are a catastrophe ! why do i put up with you ?
to have stopped this creature ? yes !
no ! she has seen too much . she knows too much .
yeah ! it 's supposed to be made outta pure gold !
because that 's where i found it . i was there .
want to know ?
twenty-five percent , and not one single farthing more .
the last time i was at that place everybody i was with died .
yes , i 'm hoping to find a certain artifact , a book , actually , my brother thinks there 's treasure . what do you think is out there ?
oh that 's comforting .
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys .
who was talking about what ?
gee , yeah , you told me it was the best time you ever had .
no . i 've never seen a mummy look like this . he 's , he 's still ...
it 's just a book , no harm ever came from a book .
there goes that belief again . not me , i am outta here !
the creature ! ? are you sure ! ?
i have no choice .
right now , i only wish to join them .
oh no , not another worthless trinket , jonathan , if i bring one more piece of junk to the curator to try and sell for you .
way to go , evy .
after all , you rode us night and day to win that bet .
still ...
did you ever see him eat ?
shut-up and get me off of here !
read the inscription on the cover !
yeah ? well , ... i 'm sure she 's not a total loss .
um , well , you see ...
i only gamble with my life , never my money .
be nice . that thing saved my life .
and it stinks to high heaven in here .
no kiddin ' , without a key , it 'll take us a month to crack this thing ,
rat gizzards . they smell bad and taste worse , but that 's the best the desert has to offer .
must of got a little too frisky with the pharaoh 's daughter .
that 's one of the plagues , right ? the grasshopper plague !
and then he 'll be coming after evy .
and now he 's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
i 'm with you , old man . no one touches my sister like that and gets away with it .
you have got to be joking ?
fantasizing ... about you .
really ?
my father had this friend ... he was an inventor ...
and some sandwiches --
well we can 't call ourselves the mystery people .
the inscrutable six ?
i can 't .
i thought you 'd never ask .
half a dirty dozen !
hello ?
captain who ?
they hurt ... but they don 't stop me !
why not ?
yes .
i just know .
i know i haven 't got it entirely worked out yet , but i 've always dreamed of becoming a superhero ... weren 't you guys ever a kid ? didn 't you ever need someone to just give you a chance ?
good or evil , what 's the difference ?
look !
yeah yeah -- and that , too .
yeah .
but we know they 're out there . hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely , unknown superheroes , who desperately need a cause ...
he 's got the fact that he 's superman !
because that 's what it is .
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is !
but we don 't know for sure it 's the same guy .
shhh .
normal . what 's normal ? does normal exist ? and if it did , how would we know it ?
yes .
no .
yes .
are you sure he 's still alive ?
the bazookas ?
and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since .
but how do we get in ?
it 's suicide .
i , personally , am convinced that he will withdraw his army from moscow , and attempt to establish himself in poland for the winter . in the end , he will not allow himself to be cut off from paris . but i believe that if he is offered any encouragement , by your majesty , he will postpone this decision as long as possible . he is a gambler and he will trust to his luck .
ah , well , that is the first rule of warfare . you must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear . you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom .
oh , i 'm sorry about that .
to citizen general bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife . you should know , citizen general , that your wife has taken a lover , one captain hippolyte charles ... undated and unsigned .
i am afraid , then , i have to ask you both , joseph as my brother , and junot as my good friend , whether or not you know anything about this , or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it .
yes , yes , please sit down . i will be with you in a moment .
yes .
ah , you must forgive me , my dearest marie-louise , i saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at schonbrunn .
monsieur varlac , i will count slowly to five , and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then , i will carry out your execution , on the spot .
life is a burden for me . nothing gives me any pleasure ; i find only sadness in everything around me . it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live , and probably always shall live , are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight .
good .
daddy , uncle elroy , i need your help .
yup .
thank you . i only got two bullets in the mothafucka , but it 's better than nothing .
not me .
that 's fuckin ' poetic , craig .

there hain 't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook mister gar . what a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair .
shoot , a horse-hair 'll hold a lumpin ' whale .
if you got an appetite for bones and bitterness .
you don 't hardly get settled till you 're frettin ' to git home again .
a man of the cloth ?
i thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
come on !
it 's a shame !
you ain 't leavin ' in no hurry if we can help it !

somewheres . i don 't know yet .
that 's daddy !
ssh ...
he ain 't my dad .
a feller can 't just go around with run-down , busted watches .
in the cellar . buried under a stone in the floor .
you could save him , little bird .
it is my shame -- my crown of thorns . and i must wear it bravely .
do ? why stay and take care of them little kids . maybe it was never meant for a woman like willa to taint their young lives .
he don 't mean no impudence ; do you , boy ? do you , boy ? ah , many 's the time poor brother ben told me about these youngins .
well , john , the night before your father died , he told me what he did with that money .
it 's about that john and that pearl ?
no , nothing .
i sure as hell hope so .
thank god .
mysteries . incredible body hookus pokus . truth is we still don 't know what they are or where they come from . as for nightmares ... did you know that in the last three years twenty filipino refugees in california died in the middle of nightmares ? not from heart attacks , either . they just died .
she 's entering deep sleep now . heart rate 's a little high due to anxiety , but otherwise she 's nicely relaxed . all normal . she could dream at any time now . right now she 's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one 's mapped yet . waiting to see what shows up .
get the kit !
then bring us back its tail and whiskers .
oh -- jeez -- glen ! rod 's gone ape !
shut up and let me in . you ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet ?
shhh . now listen , here 's what we 're gon na do ...
don 't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out .
dad , i want to see rod lane .
it so happens i work here , and there 's an unsolved murder . i don 't like unsolved murders , especially ones my daughter 's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour ? you 're supposed to be getting some sleep .
oh , jesus -- nancy ! hey ! we got a fire !
i'd 've canned your ass if you hadn 't . what you got ?
something like a razor was the weapon , but nothing found on the scene .
uh , she just saw you , sir ...
'anything funny ' like what ?
right .
put that damned thing down !
i don 't even have it on me , so forget it .
we should get her out of here ...
how the fuck do i know ? i don 't expect you to believe me .
i mean , it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time . but invisible razors . she just ... opened up ...
no .
right . well , she didn 't , exactly ...
guys can have nightmares too , y'know . you ain 't got a corner on the fucking market or something .
positively not !
that 's another thing ... it 's spring .
... des raisins de madre , des framboises ...
i know , but if we can 't put in all these wonderful things at least let 's put in some imagination . in that one omelet we 'll taste the whole of paris !
imagine , we don 't have to whisper any longer .
for ourselves ... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants ' quarters .
leon , how would you like to have three lifelong friends ?
that 's right ... and we might as well face it .
and that 's something we owe to ninotchka .
how many families live here with you ?
just see how happy the people look ... from here ... .
let 's forget the future ... let 's stop being sentimental ... let 's start that omelet .
no , no .
that 's right .
don 't worry ... there will be enough .
i must be stern with you .
oh , yes , yes .
go to bed .
yes .
that 's perfect !
let 's be honest . have we anything like it in russia ?
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana , but , like all private property , they were confiscated by the state .
soviet russia will put all its might behind this case .
how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like ?
while you eat , you look at the view .
thank you for a wonderful dinner .
... it is in the air ... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street ... .
i 'll send you a muff .
too bad we have to waste all that time .
just a moment . i hope you haven 't closed this deal , monsieur mercier . it might bring you into serious difficulties .
don 't make an issue of my womanhood . we are here for work ... all of us . let 's not waste time . shall we go ?
why ? ... why should you carry other people 's bags ?
no , not a thing . would you like to go out ?
well , we 're back home .
even the swallows are back .
i kissed the polish lancer too ... before he died .
foolish ? if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other , and when i caught up with it i would say , `` just a moment , you charming little dress , i want you to meet ninotchka ... you two were meant for each other . '' ninotchka feels more comfortable .
no . nobody will find us .
so -- you 're behind all this . i should have known .
rakonin , bless him , has given me the most amazing news !
i 'm going , leon ... but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown , madame yakushova . is that what they 're wearing in moscow this year ?
a very wise suggestion , leon . i 'm afraid madame and i will never agree . the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week . i understand everything will be over by thursday . am i right ?
it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris . be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow . good night . good night , leon .
of course not , my dear ! i didn 't come here with any such suspicion . how ridiculous ! nor did i come here to pick up his hat .
thank you so much , my friend . i will get in touch with you .
then tell richardson to fire him .
you don 't need to check the tape . i know what i said .
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here .
nobody knows more about this thing than you do , john .
anyway , they had to take her to bellevue . maybe she 'll stay this time .
it 's the fall of the roman empire , are you blind ? and we 're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
yeah , i knew it . i knew it from '69 on , and i said it all along , didn 't i ...
sir , there 's dead american kids here . let 's say we don 't apologize for kent state , but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
looks like he talked to joe kraft ... and to the times . told them he was dead set against the bombing , that you were ... `` unstable . '' claims he has to handle you `` with kid gloves '' ...
no , no . he 's our only `` star '' right now . he 'd go crying straight to the press . he 'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch ! get someone from our staff on his ass . tap his phones . i want to know everyone he talks to .
damn right . and there 's still a helluva lotta people out there who wan na believe ... that 's the point , isn 't it ? they wan na believe in the president .
the hell he will ! fire him , too . if you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the justice department , fire the sonofabitch ! and ...
we 'll work on it . i say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that 's all there is to it .
no , keep trini out of this . chotiner 's too old . and for god 's sake , keep colson out . it 's time to baptize our young counsel . that means dean can never talk about it . attorney-client privilege . get to it . and dean -- you stay close on this .
the bastard ! if i 'd called his shot on cuba i would 've won . he made me look soft .
chile , congo , guatemala , cuba . wherever 's there 's a need for an executive action capability , there 's a track 2 . in cuba , track 1 was the bay of pigs invasion . track 2 ... it was our idea . we felt the invasion wouldn 't work unless we got rid of castro . so we asked ourselves -- who else wants castro dead ? the mafia , the money people . so we put together track 2 ...
i tell you , the soldiers were provoked . now stop this pussyfooting around . dead kids ! how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this ? i mean , if cambodia doesn 't work , we 'll bomb hanoi if we have to .
don 't forget , the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your maker ... don 't forget to be on god 's side .
why me ?
is it my turn ?
harold ... can i get you anything ?
yes ... it involves some old and forgotten papers . things i signed as vice president . i want the originals in my office and i don 't want copies anywhere else .
he 's lying , clyde . always has . that 's why nixon 's always been useful . hold still . and take your hand off your hip .
dogs ... season starts tomorrow . it keeps me calm . i don 't like going back into the same building four times .
we 'll see about that .
... and what do we get for it ? gobs and gobs of bullshit , gossip , nothing ! someone is leaking . we 've got to stop the leaks , henry , at any cost , do you hear me ? then we can go for the big play -- china , russia .
we have to entertain the possibility ...
jews and negros don 't win elections , henry . better to hang them around the democrats ' necks .
yeah ...
i was the lesser of two evils .
free , if you 're the president .
... but it 's not , bottom-line , gon na change a goddamn thing , john . the question is : how do we screw ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of god into all leakers ?
you know , this kinda thing , you got ta be brutal . a leak happens , the whole damn place should be fired . really . you do it like the germans in world war ii . if they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them , they 'd line the whole goddamned town up and say : `` until you talk you 're all getting shot . '' i really think that 's what has to be done . i don 't think you can be mr. nice-guy anymore ...
how do you know that , john ? did we try ? are we just giving up like the rest of 'em ? what 's hoover found , for god 's sake ?
you all know me . i 'm one of you , i grew up a stone 's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda ...
... but it was all we had .
mr. nixon .
and we got the `` big mo '' ! we 're back !
tell 'em what you like ; they 'll never understand it anyway .
we ... haven 't announced anything ... uh ...
i asked him , `` lyndon , what would you do , on a scale of one to ten ? '' and he said , `` bomb the shit out of hanoi , boy ! bomb them where they live . '' ... john , do you think i was too soft on tv ?
but they never will , dick . no matter how many elections you win , they never will .
i don 't know . my mind wanders .
yessir . we should a brought wieners .
mm .
i don 't know ...
that 's very nice .
three years ago i said them very words . no and good .
at the gettin ' place .
baby , at what point would you quit botherin ' to look for your two million dollars ?
things happened . i can 't take 'em back .
i 'm gon na borrow a car . from eldon .
you from around here ?
i don 't know . will there ?
there 's somebody lookin ' for me . not police . just call me if anyone else checks in tonight .
i 'm just one person . don 't matter the size of the bed .
i know , i 've seen him . sort of .
to kill your wife .
he isn 't . you 're not cut out for this . you 're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles .
that 's it ! you 're gone !
listen ! i saw 'chloe ' and 'lonnie ' on t.v . they 're television characters .
she said she was in arizona , did she ?
no , i didn 't have to .
you shut up ! they 're beautiful , but get them some water .
yes ... not the actor , though , the doctor . i think .
the day i left you i just drove and drove . i drove all day and all that night , and i didn 't go anywhere . i just kept driving . i stopped at a little country church , and the pastor let me in , and i sat --
i don 't know . why do you keep calling me george ?
you 're late , eric .
stop calling me david . we 're on set , for christ 's sake , you don 't have to call me david here .
why am i doing this to you ? isn 't this what you wanted ?
... what ? what did you call me ? george ... mccord . you 're my favorite actor on ...
williams , arizona . about halfway there , i guess .
... did i win some contest ?
'david . ' that 's your guy . so , you staying with him ?
this is crazy . i come home , you go to your room . you go in the kitchen , i go to my room . it 's stupid .
... okay .
i don 't think so . rosa , i didn 't kill del ... they did .
georgia . in case i didn 't tell you , it 's cash only , gentlemen .
... and put them in your mouth .
beer , please .
wesley ... your wife 's a very lovely woman . have i seen her before ?
i 'm just curious . can 't you give me an example ?
that 's what i thought . you better give me another example .
we don 't . but a '97 le sabre 'll be easy to find if it 's here , town this size ... he said he gave his wife some car as a gift , remember ?
... she 's got class , and poise . lots of poise ...
i 'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face .
yes , i am and we 're not going . act professional .
maybe she had to use the bathroom . she pees , doesn 't she ? ! ...
well , you were right about what that bartender said .
i can 't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him .
no ! no problem , there is no ... what is the problem ? just do that ... thing ... you do ! come on ! you drove me nuts with this for three days , now do it !
no ! let me try this !
sure .
look joyce , i need your key to the files , not advice , okay ? this is a complex case .
names , a phone number , something ... listen , ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from detroit was murdered , but do you see him doing anything about it ? if ballard wasn 't such a stubborn ass , i wouldn 't have to be breaking in here ...
oh , yeah ... man , i 'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face , watch her bubble burst in mid-air .
gopher , everett ?
you mis'able little sneak thief ...
yeah , it stinks in that ol ' barn .
good lord , what do we do ?
don 't know , delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin ' for their lack of sight , even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers . now clearly , seein ' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery . it 's not so surprising , then , if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
fire ! i hate fire !
what 'd the devil give you for your soul , tommy ?
well ya know , delmar , they say that with a thrill-seekin ' personality , what goes up must come down . top of the world one minute , haunted by megrims the next . yep , it 's like our friend george is a alley cat and his own damn humors 're swingin ' him by the tail . but don 't worry , delmar ; he 'll be back on top again . i don 't think we 've heard the last of george nelson .
course it 's pete ! look at 'im !
i never knocked over any armored- car . i was sent up for practicing law without a license .
boys , we was chained together . i hadda tell ya somethin ' . bustin ' out alone was not a option !
oh my god !
everett , my beard itches .
honey , it 's just - shutup , delmar - it 's just -
oh , yes , assa parful new force .
okay , pappy .
assa good idea , pappy .
just a little change of cast . me and the little lady are gon na pick up the pieces'n retie the knot , mixaphorically speakin ' . you boys 're invited , of course . hell , you 're best men ! already got the rings .
well sure , honey , but ...
the hell you say ! wash is kin !
sell that . i figured it could only have painful associations for wash .
pete , don 't be ignorant-
for him , not for the law ! i 'm surprised at you , pete . hell , i gave you credit for more brains than delmar .
join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition ? thank you anyway . and i like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point .
what about you , delmar ? what 're you gon na do with your share a that dough ?
isn 't it , uh ...
... i believe , unless i 'm very much mistaken - see , we 've been away for several years , uh ...
quitcha babblin ' pete - time to skedaddle .
but ... but ...
nearest ford auto man 's bristol .
blooey !
buyin ' nipples !
maybe we 'll be roommates , seeger , and you 'll find out how funny i really am ...
just trying to have fun . that fucking prison is really starting to get to me . c'mon , seeger . gim me a push . fuck you guys ! i 'll do it myself !
fuck the record . now you listen to me and do exactly what i tell you . start back ten yards and take off from here . not here ... or there ... but right here ! no excuses , seeger ! you are going to plant those legs here and then you 're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to ! you want jets ? then do it , goddamnit !
i don 't mean anything by it .
no , sir !
yes , sir !
yeah . see you in the fleet , sarge . and thank you .
zack , don 't !
but you knew right off what i was talking about , didn 't you , paula ! did you let that boy --
yes , ma'am . four long , hard weeks of sacrifice for my country ... for my people ... for you . but i survived .
now what on earth would give you an idea like that ?
don 't worry . i 'll respect you afterwards .
my responsibility as its father , for one . i mean , if i 've made you pregnant , i 'd want to ... do the right thing .
that 's right . let 's get married , lynette . let 's find a justice of the peace and just do it !
one more minute .
come on . let 's go dance .
i got my foot on the floor .
big sid came in about two and a half seconds , then had the nerve to ask , 'did you make it , too , sweetheart ? '
i haven 't made up my mind .
any time , sailor .
i understand . maybe we 'll see each other after the show ...
he said it 's up to us and i got here first , didn 't i ?
hey , sid , thanks .
i 've seen better .
not if you make it worth my while . how about free boonies for the duration ?
it 's grown out more than an inch , sweetheart .
shhhh ...
yeah .
a little .
lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn 't call this week .
but it can 't wait .
just like that it 's all over ? with less than two weeks to go , you 're out ?
not with me . not with people .
she didn 't .
make her come out . and when she does , that 's when we got ta be careful . she can 't get out of this house . she can 't even think she can get out of this house . we just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes . and i don 't want joe pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger . that 's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in greenhaven . so we 're gon na seal the place up . they wan na hole up in here ? fine , we 'll help 'em . make it impossible for them to leave . once they come out of that room .
she better .
you finish . then we finish .
fuck you , i 'm gone !
you 're an idiot .
kid ! no elevator !
it 's quite in vogue in high end construction right now . one really can 't be too careful about home invasion .
not at all .
open it .
don 't !
on the floor ! get on the floor !
shhh ...
they 're hurting us , baby . huey locked up . bobby seale running all over the country holding things together . cy dead . little bobby ... i don 't recognize half the faces at meetings .
no ! this is my private property . according to california law we have a constitutional right to bear arms .
damn straight ... let 's go check out these paper panthers .
you know it brother .
yeah .
shut up . just shut the fuck up .
mothafuck ... hey ! ! ! what the hell ! ! !
party needs the bread . be hip to the struggle , only a dollar ! ! !
that would be an excellent start . tell him to keep a low profile .
cut the crap , you 've been taking the man 's money for years . now it 's time you earned it .
neither your stomach or your opinion matters here dorsett ... what matters is that mr. trafficante and the bureau have come up with a solution to our panther problem . one might say ... the final solution .
you talk as if this thing 's already been decided .
i refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me .
again i 'll take the fifth amendment on that question .
the white power structure wants us to act like savages . but we 're a different kind of animal altogether . we 're panthers . and the black panther party for self defense is very painfully aware that america has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country . so we need to organize , we keep our shit correct ! and effect revolution . we revolve the power into the hands of the people . where it belongs . power to the people baby ...
yeah ... but it seems they 're bringing malcolm 's widow betty shabazz to town , to speak at a rally , do an interview for ramparts . and they want us to help with security .
where you been ? i saw the cops rousting you at the rally .
you know i think brother judge needs our support right now , not our suspicion this is beautiful man . folks around here never read the truth like this before .
you got that right . and brother , i got a feeling it 's going to get a whole lot thicker .
what you see is what you got . that 's ' bobby seale .
just the legit shit .
later for that . i 'm done either way ...
just come for the food , man . ain 't quite sure what their bag is but ...
i don 't know . but i 'm sure i 'll find out . rose , you did me solid .
it 's alright . i 'm very happy for you .
you 're the worst of that sort . you 're the sort that gives that sort a bad name .
pride will do .
no , he takes after his mother ...
he 's not making light .
he 's my father .
thank you .
our governor is a bigger fool than i thought .
they refused to give me their names . their ranks are nine lieutenants , five captains , three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow . their posts ? we picked them up here-and-there last night .
sir .
yes , sir .
i understand , sir .
unless i 'm dreaming , i think i see irregulars at their center .
thank you . how 's the spotted one 's milk ?
yes .
he tried . it didn 't take .
yes ... ... father .
and the dogs , too , i 'll wager .
i 'm sorry , i didn 't know .
robert . robert e. lee .
thank you . did you finish the upper field ?
quiet .
you 'll see soon enough , hon .
is that right , dad ?
yaay !
but what if he dies and has to go to the pet sematary ?
in a minute , hon . let gage finish his turn .
well , i thought it was safe --
for a little while .
to remember .
missy dandridge . and she says it 's a operation !
fine ... except when mom was airing gage 's diaper rash , he walked away and got into grampa 's study and pooped in grampa 's favorite chair .
sure .
nope . the micmac indians . what 's up ahead is all that 's left of their tribal lands .
aw , you 'll be okay . less than a mile .
yes .
you going to bury him in the pet sematary ?
you 're telling me .
just don 't stop , louis . you don 't ever want to stop down here in little god . and you don 't ever want to look behind you , whatever you hear .
stanny b. did for me what i did for you last night , louis . only i wasn 't alone when spot came back .
this babe has said enough .
why ... that sometimes dead is better . that 's all . sometimes dead is better .
you don 't understand --
louis , the house is beautiful .
yes -- thanks . i 'm louis creed .
extraordinarily morbid , maybe .
according to what mr. crandall says , the road 's a lot more dangerous than the operation . church will be just the same . well -- almost the same -- and we won 't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn orinco trucks .
don 't shilly-shally , louis . give the little girl her promise .
you 're doing fine .
eh ? you have my word , then -- on the good book , i do swear , and the lord spare my worthless soul .
quite , boy , or you 'll lose your tongue . those as know me know i wouldn 't cross my word , and bring down bad luck on the ship . i agreed to set them free . i didn 't when ... nor where .
the last time you do this , you left me a pistol , with one shot .
all right then .
because , right about now , the h.m.s . dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor .
men ! are you up for it ?
and he 's got old bill 's courage . a curse on him , and you !
by the powers , you 're right ! where 's jack 's pistol ? who 's got it ? bring it forward !
very well .
elizabeth -- turner . i 'm a maid in the governor 's household .
aye . and not a bit of it any use to us , only hoarded . but it will drive us no longer .
will -- you can 't trust him .
think again , miss swann . vile and dissolute creatures , the lot of them . i intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag , or wears a pirate brand , gets what he deserves : a short drop and a sudden stop .
yes -- yes .
is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts ?
about the day we met . do you remember ?
truthfully -- you were a bit late .
i guess you can never truly know someone else 's heart .
the trees are taller .
don 't be thinking i 'm not already working on it .
that he is .
she can hold a bit longer .
we 're catching up !
ah , that 's a dark and unpleasant tale , best left untold .
i know . that was for the smell .
will -- it 'll go worse for us -- for elizabeth , especially -- if we fight .
wait for my order -- what the blazes is that ?
i don 't think that will be necessary .
sorry , i didn 't know .
captain jack sparrow . if you please .
indeed .
we are bound for port royal , not isla de muerta .
remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
aye ! avast !
these are the only ones worth having . and we 're going to need them --
the pistol . when a pirate is marooned , will , he 's given a pistol with a single shot . no good for hunting , or surviving , really . but after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good .
this way !
my name is will turner , the son of bootstrap bill turner . his blood runs in my veins . you need my blood . and on my word i will pull this trigger , and sink all the way down to davy jones ' locker !
it 's the right way .
and no lies !
until he 's done .
do ? well , i suppose that depends on you .
maybe you should , but you can 't .
oh no . you 're not like me . in fact , i 'm betting you 're the same greedy , remorseless , egomaniacal bad guy you always were .
you 're right . place a call to our friends at the network and to mr. joplin at the e.p.a .
no , icky , this is real .
dr. nebbleman , take care of them .
excellent . how long until the assembler tank is complete ?
thank you , sir .
you 're looking for a urine sample .
so , i guess it worked .
it was a long time ago , daniel . we were young , different people , heading in different directions . that 's all .
all i 'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you 're interested in , have money because that 's what they 're interested in ! money !
susan , this is the future of america here .
if you don 't want to do it this way , i can remove it surgically .
i 'm glad you came to me for help .
daniel , i didn 't hear you come down ...
sort of . we used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers .
i 'm not leaving without you , susan !
forget it , pissboy ! you tell argon he can call my lawyer .
oh yeah ?
the question is , are you ?
you won 't . that 's why you 're whispering .
don 't worry , four eyes .
'paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured . '
dexter .
i think you should , miss gallagher .
decent ? why miss schuyler , i want to be noble .
no ? why not ?
i stole them when i was interviewing babykins about bobo .
no - give you another guess .
so , it 's obvious , huh ?
sure , i 'll take a chance .
gallagher , this is mrs. smith .
why , down at the office , we always look at gallagher as - eh - just gallagher , that 's all .
yes , i said it . sure , i said it . i didn 't say it for publication , however .
good morning . what does this mean ?
why
hey , make up your mind , will you ?
no , it 's just little bingy baker .
do you call yourself a reporter ?
quitting ? i 'm not thinking about quitting .
i like my bath all right . how do you like your bath ?
oh , but you didn 't engage me , sir .
there you are . you caught on . you see , you 're nice and you 're smart too . you caught on right away . outside ! go on ! outside ! and don 't come back !
come on , come on . here they come , gallagher ! here they come !
sure . i wish you all the luck in the world , pal .
right !
who , bingy ? yeah , bingy would . he never saw fifty dollars before . you could have bought him for six bits . funny thing about bingy . the more he gets - the more he prints . he looks stupid , doesn 't he ? but oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter .
go ? ! wait a minute - that 's a great story ! newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from schuyler mansion , and
hello , joe .
i have . double-strength !
yes , i 'm sorry , i struck him right here in your house . and i 'll strike anybody in anybody 's house that calls me a cinderella man .
i understand , sir .
that 's what i think of it , bingy !
yes , sir .
very good , sir .
thanks .
sure .
we 're in pleasantville ?
it can 't be possible .
i can 't go out there . how can i go out there ?
in my handbag .
thanks .
she 's crying .
no ...
yeah . it does .
i don 't want it to go away .
um ... it 's ...
yes i do .
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want .
still doesn 't make it right .
very well ...
nothing .
... lover 's lane ?
oh ... right .
it was a prop for the school play ...
no i won 't . i swear .
i am actually ... glad to see you 've finally shown your true colors .
thanks . but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year . and then i thought `` gee . that seems awfully silly . that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment , don 't you think ? ''
i don 't know what i 'd do if i couldn 't paint anymore bud . i just don 't know what i 'd do ...
what 's the rush ?
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him ?
yeah ... saw you too .
yeah .
ok . thank you .
i don 't know .
nothing . i 'm just at work and i 'm wondering , you know your friend lena ?
that 's not mine it 's one of the guys that works here . that pudding 's not mine .
... i thought i should tell you . i didn 't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
ok .
yeah .
we back our plungers 100 % and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor ... ..
i think you have a call ?
... .i have seven .
my name is barry egan and i spoke to you ... .you called me , you remember ?
... it just ... .i don 't know ... .i don 't know .
are you learning how to play the piano ? what is that ?
ok .
`` ... a poker ... he took a poker from the fire ... ''
we can 't . all we can do is guard against our own corruption .
i 've you to look after me , haven 't i ?
`` turn you out ? ''
honestly ! you cut me to the core ! what 's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when i finally succumb -- when at long last , i pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion ? have you no faith in your own medicine ?
don 't be absurd ; it 's only a play .
your wig . remove your wig .
tomorrow , we 'll cut out your tongue .
a few indiscretions in his youth .
a man of his notoriety ? he wouldn 't last a day on the streets without capture .
oh indeed ?
do more . otherwise , i 'll be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum .
what could cause a tincture like this ?
you 'd suffer in her stead ?
sweet , then ? like the pastry ?
now 's not the time to be cheeky , maddy .
i put myself at life and limb . surely that 's worth a few louis .
what 's that then ?
tortures so arcane , so medieval , even i haven 't the words to describe them . if you 've an ounce of pity in your heart , you 'll throw caution aside , and unlock my door ...
it 's only been described to me . in your books .
you 're far crueler than i , my sweet .
`` what shall i ready ? '' asked fanchon . `` my mouth , my ass or my succulent oyster ? ''
oh you do , do you ? it is my dearest hope , doctor , that he remain entombed forever , and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution , he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms .
now is the time to secure your epitaph . the benevolent marquise , charenton 's most revered philanthropist ... or satan 's bride .
... .shame on you , truly ...
how was i to tell you ? by writing a letter ? with what , my asinine bride ?
yeah
yes .
one . . . buys things .
orson , please ... it 's too bright
kinda .
yeah , ain 't it swell ?
again .
again .
again
again
again
the ad..
happy birthday .
five ... ? yes . no . we 're done today
you were great , jake . just like old times . good thing sugar ray wasn 't here tonight . oh jake , this is state 's attorney bronson and his wife .
i 'm the only guy ever to beat sugar ray , and i still don 't have a shot at the title .
no , take her home . i wan na be alone for a while . everybody go .
don 't be long . i 'm afraid with all these tough guys here .
don 't talk . keep at it . jab , jab , jab . you 're ahead on points .
you don 't get nothin ' done by watchin ' . you just got ta do it . here , i 'll help you .
can you see it ?
that 's all right . he don 't mind .
oh , jake .
tryin ' to get this fuckin ' tv to work . paid all this money for it and still can 't get a station a mile away . and mr. wizard here ain 't no help .
jake , sit down for a minute .
yeah , the weight 's ok .
get lost . hey kids , `` a cop is a rat . '' remember that , `` a rat . ''
i 'll suck your eyes out ! i 'll fuckin ' take the two of you .
that 's what they call a family problem .
i was jaywalking .
too bad . the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time .
oh -- i almost forgot !
mrs. thorwald .
you figured that out , huh ?
your logic is backward .
then if the police get me -- you won 't be around to laugh !
well , i only quote from the best .
probably . but when i do , it 'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress , a lobster dinner , and the latest scandal . i need a woman who 'll go anywhere , do anything , and love it .
it 's not an ordinary look . it 's the kind of look a man gives when he 's afraid somebody might be watching him .
uh-huh .
i 'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way .
and digging in . look at that flower bed .
look !
there 's no point in taking unnecessary chances . give me the phone book , lisa .
to bail lisa out of jail .
only because it 's expected of her .
you have , perhaps , an ambulance outside ?
no wonder he 's having so much trouble with it .
right now , it doesn 't seem so .
without any future ?
your mind is . and when i want a man , i want all of him .
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds ! coats , suits , shirts , sox , even his wife 's --
not yet !
well that 's fine , but i only have one bed , and --
lisa , i won 't be able to give you any --
i 'd be no better than thorwald , to refuse .
i think i 'll start reviving it tomorrow , with say -- miss torso for a start ?
no , lisa -- i don 't think he did .
now hold on . i 'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but i don 't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
what 's eating you , judy ? you want him alive ?
i 'm cute , too .
who 's fighting ? this is the test , man . it 's a crazy game .
how 'bout you ? say the word and you 're cold , jack -- you 're dead .
she never wants to hear . she doesn 't care !
i don 't want to learn that !
you better give me something , dad . you better give me something mom ?
open it .
well maybe she better start .
head-shrinker ?
wow ! well now-there-then !
not lately .
i had to go to a head-shrinker . i only went twice though . my mother said it cost too much , so she went to hawaii instead .
plato !
your father !
get away from me !
i 'm fine .
ray ! will you tell these guys to move back ?
it 'd stick in my throat , mom . i 'm nervous or something --
just tell a little white lie ?
grandma ?
she eats him alive and he takes it .
i feel as if i 'm walking under water .
see , we 're very modern .
oh , we can manage that ! i 'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone ...
i don 't think . i know . he looks at me like i 'm the ugliest thing in the world . he doesn 't like my friends -- he --
yes ! ! !
we 're talking , aren 't we ?
... whoever she is .
provisions ! we are not leaving that motel room again till after new year 's : we need ten days worth of provisions ! what 's good ? !
you got out , nick . you 're here . you 're my christmas .
your brother ...
nick , it won 't work . it won 't work !
they 're truck drivers .
here and there . restaurant , uh , that 's the main expansion . tables 've been moved around ; the big man 's office , i dunno , might be upstairs now .
all i wanted ... was to make it home ... for a little of dad 's turkey , and mom 's stuffing ... aunt lisbeth 's acorn gravy ... aunt mary 's cranberry buns ...
yeah . that 's love .
i never worked at no casino .
heyyy . be nice , convict . we 're gon na be working together here . get him back in the rig .
we got faith in you , nick mason . you 're our inside man .
and i worked there . for a year .
when i worked there , this was bangs , office . back here . he kept a little safe in the ... uh , the wall , money held take for himself , skim from the indians . called it the ... uh ... ... the powwow safe .
more than you know .
you get recognized , convict , you get a country-western funeral .
... ttt..tt ... two out of three ?
nick . i been trying to hit you .
't is the season , convict .
what , we walking in there and delivering toys ?
get in there and watch 'em . watch their every fuckin ' move .
monster . there never was a structure change . this place was built the same from day one .
i don 't know ... what you 're ...
open it ! ! !
hi , nick .
i been in iron mountain for two years , truck driver . i do one more crime , i 'm back there for good , so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends . you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine ? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate .
buffet is by the goddamn bar ! what the hell kind of map is this ? !
he didn 't recognize me . back off , willya ? he didn 't recognize me .
where the hell 's gabriel ?
drop the guns ! now !
yeah . you grow up in detroit , you get matured real quick .
i 'm not nick !
since when ? what the hell is this room ?
they changed the layout .
i got an idea on that one . once you 're up there , you got ta hold those guards down till some backup can get there . there 's a security camera room that videotapes everything . you 've got ta destroy every last one of those tapes .
you don 't hafta lift shit . you don 't really work there . but as far as the records are concerned , you do . i call up matthews , the foreman , tell him he 's got a new guy . you 're on the schedule . you got a timecard , it 's clocked in and out for you everyday , and you get a pay check at the end of the week . and ya know dock workers don 't do too bad . so you can move into a halfway decent place without scagnetti thinkin `` what the fuck . '' and if scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit , you 're gone that day . that day we sent you to tustin . we got ta bunch of shit you needed to unload there . you 're at the taft airstrip pickin ' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back . part of your job is goin ' different places - and we got places all over the place .
no shit , he 's gon na fuckin ' die on us if we don 't get him taken care of .
was he all pissed off ?
it makes perfect fuckin ' sense to me . eddie , you didn 't see how he acted during the job , we did .
stop pointing your fuckin ' gun at daddy !
really ? who 's your p.o . ?
this isn 't all that bad . we can give you a lot of legitimate jobs . put you on the rotation at long beach as a dock worker .
me and you 'll drive down to long beach tomorrow . i 'll introduce you to matthews , tell him what 's going on .
that 's okay , eddie , i do .
nobody saw what happened to mr. blue ?
let me say this out loud , just to get it straight in my mind . according to you , mr. blonde was gon na kill you . then when we came back , kill us , grab the diamonds , and scram . that 's your story ? i 'm correct about that , right ?
where i was from , who i knew , how i knew nice guy , had i done time , shit like that .
i tried that once , it don 't work . you get four guys fighting over who 's gon na be mr. black . since nobody knows anybody else , nobody wants to back down . so forget it , i pick . be thankful you 're not mr. yellow .
who gives a damn ?
juicy , junior , real juicy .
that piece of shit . workin ' with the cops .
shit , you shoot me in a dream , you better wake up and apologize .
look , i ordered coffee . now we 've been here a long fuckin ' time , and she 's only filled my cup three times . when i order coffee , i want it filled six times .
go down the hall , turn left , up those stairs , then turn right .
what are you gon na do about him ?
this is what he was doin ' .
graham 's got something to tell you might interest you .
maybe you won 't feel that way after i tell you what i stopped in for .
too much excitement . how about the surrey . can you fix it ?
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen . i 'm mary wells .
too much excitement . or maybe it 's just the heat . how about the surrey . can you fix it ?
i 'm not in his shoes , so leave me out of it .
so that 's it -- you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham .
yes . but -- that was the other night . now -- i don 't think i would .
i don 't expect anything . a minute ago i hadn 't cuite waked up .
i 'm sorry .
hello , miss wells .
just the grub box and bed rolls .
you better start .
like i told you , half those horses are mine . i 'm makin ' sure they get to the ranch safe . so let 's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin ' .
the whole state 's lookin ' for 'em . and they 're lookin ' for me .
what 's there to be fair about ?
what 's there to be fair about ?
me snoopin ' ? i came down here to take a bath .
no . but it 's mine and i didn 't want anyone foolin ' with it .
you wouldn 't have a smoke on you , would you ?
plenty more . and somewhere up there 's the lode , the rock rotten with it .
well cheer , why don 't you ? no more responsibilities , mary . marcia -- elaine -- me -- all taken care of . down there feeding horses and raising kids , you won 't have a thing to worry about .
well , say it .
they went on like i told you .
thank you , mr. graham .
now where 's she goin ' ? --
why didn 't you say you wanted to get married back in aspen . i told the man in sonora there were four of us . if only three show up , he might call the whole deal off . we 've got to stick together . like we 've always done .
you 'd think he 'd do it for elaine 's sake , at least ...
go ahead . get in training for the pioneer life . i 'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it .
maybe you are . i 'm not .
stop it --
yeah , we sure have .
mine 's gone lame . take a look at him .
i can 't read , ma'am . i just look at the pictures .
without someone to teach you , it 's tough .
oh , i wasn 't worrying . i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave .
thanks , steve .
steve --
never happened !
would you die already ? !
it would 've just been you , if you would 've kept your mouth shut .
hey , i have an idea ...
okay .
it 's hanson , he 's evil . let 's get him !
oh , i 'm fine ... just clowning around .
he 's so brave .
thanks . i 'm cindy .

i don 't need your help .
just wait , you 'll see .

misty , that 's a terrible thing to say ! detectives , it 's time for you to leave . my wife knows nothing about this terrible ... accident .
both of you ! get in the car !
i can 't believe i thought my own mother was a murderess !
hey , i 'm late for work . bye , honey .
misty , i made your favorite sesame broccoli ...
oh , honey !
yes , i did .
i can 't say it out loud . i don 't use bad language .
i didn 't do it !

yes . i was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister ?
i have something even better .
oh , the wine . i have forgotten the wine .
i 'd like that .
i 'm afraid not .
giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
sh-h-h nancy . the other children .
i know this is difficult for you . i know that you love her .
what about judd -- he knows about us .
we haven 't even begun tea yet .
it 's a simple question . have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband ?
absolutely not .
i 'm not planning on it .
did you see a message to call me when you got back in ?
that 's interesting , because i didn 't leave a message .
i drove around . then i went to talk with graham .
yes !
not very often .
you bitch . i knew it .
thirty-two dollars .
no .
okay .
i only get one today ? gee , how exciting .
look , i 'll call you , okay ?
what do you mean ?
goddamit ...
far as i know , yeah , that was her .
mm ? ok. be with you in a sec .
a man ... i think i recognized him ... a man who lives here . he just ... ... he just attacked me for no reason at all . i just opened the door ... i was making supper for you , and he grabbed me , he tried to kiss me ...
i hit it . i hit it with my cane . then i carry it on the cane and i throw it down to the incinerator , down to the garbage .
ok . i 'll think about it .
of course .
he needs help .
looks like 'rest home ' for this marriage .
it 's no use pussyfooting around , janet -- we have to cut quick and deep .
on the contrary . he wants to see your ratings soar . he needs a woman of exceptional desirability .
after breakfast . you 're sounding tense , janet . maybe i could give you a little massage ?
jah -- you endorse his product -- he endorses your research .
they probably meant irving and wanted you to swing .
... closed ?
it pays to know your way around , oliver .
oh i adore coleridge taylor . as a matter of fact ...
yes , betty . but the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset .
no ! i don 't know what janet 's next move will be ... but you can be sure of one thing ... it all starts here !
tenderness and innocence in denton`
that doesn 't make sense .
good ! well there 's still hope . lots of hope .
absolutely true . compared to all of them , you are perfection , flawless beauty .
of course . he was in great danger of harming himself .
i don 't think he intends to go that far .
yes how are you , janet ? are you happy ?
yes , janet . leave the crying to brad .
you 're no good
in the old series we didn 't have a convertible .
we 're not confused .
i 'm a bad girl . i 'm a bad girl .
it 'll just take a second .
you guys having fun ?
good . that 's good .
a famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday . don 't i feel special ?
i know . i might need to be spanked .
me too .
and miles is my best man , mrs. raymond . my main man .
thanks , jack . so do i . here we are .
usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities , but this one 's pretty damn good . this is the new one , right , chris ?
yeah , that would be a good move .
it 's going to be great . here 's to us .
do you know how often these pourers get hit on ?
well , i 'm glad you got it out of your system . congratulations . mission accomplished .
yeah .
she 's working . i need a break anyway . she 's getting a little clingy . this is our day !
thanks , jack .
shut up ! shut up , jack !
looks like you were in a bad car accident .
hold on .
see you .
what rehearsal dinner ?
of course i was . i mean , just now i could have made up some story , but i didn 't . i told you the truth .
it 's miles . listen , i don 't know if you even care , but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did . i think you 're great , maya -- always have . from the first time you waited on me . and while i 'm at it , i guess you should know that my book is not getting published . i thought this one had a chance , but i was wrong . again . don 't bother reading it -- you 've got better things to do . so you see i 'm not much of a writer . i 'm not anything really . the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand . we 're leaving in the morning , and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you . i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry .
thanks . um , this is ken cortland , my husband .
this is a tasting , sir . not a bar .
exactement !
where ?
bye , stephanie . bye , siena , caryl .
oh , that 's right . isn 't that nice ? i hope that girls knows how lucky she is , marrying no less than derek summersby .
and i could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out . you are staying . wendy , ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the sheraton . they do a magnificent job there . wendy is so excited you 're coming .
i just got divorced . phyllis .
it tastes old .
i heard them morgan .
who said i was going to die ?
you love walks .
what ? colleen ? ... colleen ?
you got two minor league home run records don 't you ?
bo , can you turn down the volume until officer paski leaves ?
he 's telling you the truth , edgar . whoever it was , is very strong and can jump pretty high .
that 's right .
did they say what our chances would be if they did invade ?
they already know we 're here .
we have to go in the basement .
i 'm sorry i hurt your arm .
i know . we need to be sure , before we open that door graham .
me too .
i have some upstairs .
it 's old morgan .
that means they 're unemployed .
now we 're talking . how about you merrill ?
he wasn 't drinking . ray fell asleep at the wheel .
what did you say ?
honest to god , emmett , he would 've killed me .
did it seem short to you ?
yeah ... maybe . so long .
i 'm sorry .
didn 't paden tell you that ?
yeah ... that must have been it .
and bridle-wise , too . she 's the only thing i lost i really cared about . 'cept for maybe my hat . it 's a great one . got a pretty silver band on it . my head spent three years training it . i surely do miss that hat .
anybody got any ideas ?
i 've got a job .
don 't press your luck , carter .
lucky .
where 's emmett now ?
maybe we ought to ask stella .
i am . i 'm always there , but i only shine at night .
you better get in there with her until this thing is over .
he says he doesn 't care about anything , but he does . there 's just no telling what it 's going to be .
excuse us .
how can i ? your last three pictures tanked . the board is giving me hell . no bankable star will work with you after this . if you just compromised ... a little .
thank you . what did you think , lainey ?
-- we have to talk to her , viktor !
no .
how can you bring that up at a time like this ?
no ... it 's life .
sometimes . but , just when i think your father 's changing for the better , i realize he 's as self absorbed as ever . he took the credit for simone tonight .
just a minute .
he also happens to be the most talented man i 've ever known .
it 's a re-make , hal . anders is not bigger than this picture .
simone !
i know you 'll do it , dad . you 're viktor taransky .
precisely .
she did ... didn 't she ?
i want to see her . unless you show me simone live and in person i show these pictures to the authorities .
er , ... good .
is that why she left you ?
after i saw what simone did with the role -- you know i fired all my people , went into rehab , took acting classes , changed my whole look . she really inspired me .
yes , i 'd like that .
-- what you don 't understand --
yes . yes , it is .
why do you have to bring that up ? there 's always risk -- life 's a risk . it 's worth it . besides , how could something so lovely be a crime ? well , i think we 've done enough for today . you 've been cooped up in there too long . how about you and me go out on the town ? they 're expecting us .
we can keep it in the bathroom .
do you think i should stop by on my way back ? show you what i got ? it 's not a problem .
... de profundis clamo ad te domine .
if it 's okay with you ?
next time i won 't be scared of you .
see , this is why i lose at poker . yes , i do have a question .
look over there .
he your best buddy ?
yeah . sorry .
i forgot myself .
yes .
all the time . they 're everywhere . you won 't tell anyone my secret , right ?
them ?
don 't fail me .
i guess she did .
where will you go , where no one has died ?
i definitely won 't .
i 'm ready to communicate with you now .
got it .
i know .
they 'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye ... people watching would spit at them .
you 're a stuttering stanley !
how 'd he know i 'd come ?
not according to these .
find out what 's holding things up . i want to get the hell off this farm .
sorry .
you need someone who can protect you , suzie .
bus broke down .

amen .
he 's right . you were behind .
yeah . that sounds good . `` hang a left at the first cow patty , then make a right when you see porky pig '' .
tell me you checked the bus before we left , carl .
yeah . good idea . go milk the cows , feed the chickens .
nothing to tell .
i ... heard something ... came in here last night . must have gone to sleep .

can 't help it , suze ... family sticks together ...
never .
yeah , i 'll teach you a lesson --
what a surprise . -- what about our audition ?
us ? we been ... moonlighting .
what 'll we do ?
dude 's a half -- squid . ain 't many places he can hide . sea world , maybe .
hey , grant .
aspirin .
that 's the mystery of the ages there , trev . starla was seventeen when they got engaged . he was , like , in his thirties . no one even knew they were goin ' out till she had that ring on her finger .
a martian is from mars , trevor .
shelby !
just block the doors , any way you can .
what the fuck they gon na do with her in a hospital , bill ?
shut up .
took the kids to his mom 's for the weekend .
wearing white , just like on our ... wedding day . i remember it .
heh . it ain 't as bad as it looks , sugarplum . dr. carl was just here . i had a reaction to a bee sting . he gave me a prescription . said i should be fine , in a couple days .
no ! no . heh . i 'll be right back .
what other stuff ?
through a wound on his stomach ?
margaret .
your what ?
yeah , it 's the highlight of my day .
if ... ?
you know how rumors start .
i forget to tell you . i 'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew .
you know , you 're not a bad passenger .
i don 't know . we were planning on seeing the astrodome .
eleven .
he 's after us again !
like what ?
no , actually i was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon .
you take the front , i 'll take the back .
bandit ii ?
sleep for a week . wan na join me ?
another time .
how 'd you know ?
yeah , i can tell he 's gon na be a major asset .
running blocker .
can a pig whistle ?
this is bandit i , come back .
if i knew , cledus ; i 'd be on college bowl .
i 'll believe it when i see it .
ticking away , but it looks like a clear shot to hot town . green lights and white lines all the way .
see , running coors beer east of texas is what bothers me . it makes me a bootlegger .
wonderful psychology . why don 't you say something about my mom ? excuse me .
believe me , that won 't be a problem .
you 're soundin ' real bodacious . back .
because i wan na see this hot shot bandit do something that can 't be done . besides , there 's nothing i like better than breaking legends .
and everybody , all the time . yeah , it 's a chore .
have them mobilized . i 'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured . we need to keep israel sequestered in that penthouse .
get a coroner 's estimate too . -- miss , i 've been transferred and i was disconnected . no one is answering and i need someone from security to pick up that line . it 's urgent .
yeah , why .
i sent hugo , he should be there !
shit , if you 're on a crazy jag , why stop there , why not take fort knox with a fucking slingshot or go into hell after hitler ... i like your chances a lot more .
... to what ? incinerate ? 'cuz i 'm almost dead certain there 's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory ! some shit , suffice it to say , just don 't wash out . now , the money question ... to whom does that stain belong ?
sparazza was the one who introduced israel to the life , gave him his first big break , brought him through the ranks .
his testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what 's left of the la cosa nostra is this country . that alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with witness protection .
israel 's legal representation , the firm of culpepper , brody and reed , which is currently the subject of a joint sec and treasury department probe , were left holding the bag after he skipped bail . over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that 's set to expire in less than a day . rupert reed , one of the firm 's partners , has learned of israel 's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of jack dupree to pick him up and return him to las vegas ... that can 't happen . we have a gulf stream standing by at reagan international to transport you two to lake tahoe . it 's very simple gentlemen . valacchi , fratiano , gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of the la cosa nostra , than buddy israel .
-- brought against sparazza by israel 's mother laverne who was nineteen at the time . they had a brief affair which israel was the by- product of .
information was arriving all day yesterday . when we finally figured out who sparazza actually was , we --
primo sparazza was heller 's alias . he went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years , amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates . he may have ripped the organization wide open , pre-appalachia , but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue , swapped allegiances ... so they gave the order to terminate his cover .
c'mon , i say we bounce now , kick it for a lil ' bit , play some craps . ... maybe spend the night ?
she reappeared exactly as she had before ?
yes .
oh , that 's a relief .
i won 't be making the trip .
yes .
you don 't know ?
i don 't know . i couldn 't understand why you didn 't tell me .
it 's genetics . you know this . you know where it comes from . there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires .
i know . i 'm putting that in my next report .
snow thinks we shouldn 't leave until we figure out a way to document it , to prove its existence to the planet earth . this is hilarious : he thinks it 's god , but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home .
how can i tell ? you 've seen both of me . i only know what you 're like here . you 're all i know . there is no `` you '' from before .
i don 't think it knows it 's torturing us . it 's just watching .
we want to talk freely .
i 'm not snow .
you go ahead . of what i remember about earth ... it 's all one thing now . everything 's a blur . i like distinctions .
it 's okay ... i 've never been a detective before either ...
oh ... yes ... i don 't have it with me . it 's at home .
nice . maybe you 'll stop by ... have an aperitif ...
i got money .
not too sure about that .
i came on at 8:00 .
yeah . i liked being around you too ... claire .
yeah ...
listen , i 'll ... see you again .
... i don 't want to talk about it ...
sure we are , let 's go !
i don 't know tommy .
absolutely .
too kinky .
well , actually , she looks better than that .
i want you and tommy to stay with my mother .
what 's the difference ?
no .
when i want your advise , keegan , i 'll make an appointment .
discourage it . but stay with her if you can 't . call it in first so we can have a car on tail . she 's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine ... okay , let 's check it out .
i heard .
it should 've been me ...
i just got ta talk to her , t.j .
i 'm relieved at 4:00 a.m .
just `` lay back , mack '' ... lay back ...
we 're gon na pass the street .
peter parker , you have no idea what i did this weekend . or didn 't do . it 's no business of yours either way .
at least this ensemble doesn 't glow in the dark .
let me see .
hm . what a lump .
they 'll never take me alive .
why home ? the real world beckons , man ! the possibilities are endless . want to go up to the world trade center and laugh at new jersey ?
i think you 're trying to tell me something .
just about . you see , i also have this amazing strength ...
thank god .
i 'm sure you kept warm .
unh-huh . excuse me . i 've got ta go .
just shut up and close your eyes . this 'll hurt .
why ?
nah .
precise equipment such as waldos
that 's the understatement of the year .
your records are older than you are . have you never heard of new wave ?
oh , peter . a zit .
you were adorable . the least you could do is use a glass .
i couldn 't care less . what i 've done is --
no !
yup . oh , here 's your check , minus my commission . solid , solid novelty act .
i just gave -- yeah , sure .
i 'm not so happy myself .
sure , in the war . pull those cables --
i don 't have to think . we didn 't tell anything to anybody . not a word . not until we hit this barrack .
looks good outside .
that 'll do .
we 'll get some more .
no crack . two packs of cigarettes say they don 't get out of the forest .
take it .
why not ?
forget it .
i 'll call the whole pot .
okay , security -- what happened ?
easy ! walked right through the gate , past the guard . like he was some kraut field marshal .
everybody but joey , and you know who .
yes , it would . do we know each other ?
animal ! animal ! aren 't you ashamed of yourself ? a couple of guys are trying to escape and you 're thinking of broads . broads ?
let go , animal ! it 's roll call ! hitler wants to see you !
they 'll shoot you , animal !
it 's beautiful ! you goin ' to eat it all yourself ?
he 's the grrrrreatest !
come on , baby ! daddy 's going to buy you a hunk of cheese !
you hold him . i 'll slug him .
come on , you little stooge . hand over them keys .
animal ! got a little something for you !
why , sure !
kill it , duke . it 's got us all spinning .
take some men and get the antenna going . let 's see if we can catch the bbc .
and don 't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler .
i want everybody out of here . we 'll need a lot of commotion on the compound .
you have elected me security . the way things have been going in this barracks , i guess i 've done a poor job and i want to make up for it . is that asking too much ?
come on , everybody ! let 's go !
just one question . did you calculate the risk ?
are we boring you ?
it adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy . because i 'm telling you . the krauts wouldn 't plant two stoolies in one barrack . and whatever you do to me you 're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy .
don 't you know ? because i got my own ideas . let 's have that civilian stuff .
they know about that gadget . i 'd worry more about the radio .
what about the radio ?
ach , terrible ! such foolish boys . such nice boys . i 'd better not talk about it . it makes me sick to my stomach .
you are trying to say that an american would inform on other americans ?
no ! no !
not particularly .
ja ! ja ! droppen sie dead !
just don 't drool on it .
what was i going to do with them ? i only smoke cigars .
come on , let 's get that mail . anything for stanislaus kuzawa ?
oh ! somebody was peeking !
maybe those russian dames would take him .
tell you what to do . first , get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the kraut guards . then get yourself another face .
we 'll consider it a prisoner exchange .
thanks for pointing that out .
you get what ?
it appears to be a magnetically sealed .
i am sorry , but i can not stop myself . i think something is wrong
one minute to warp core breach .
the station complement was nineteen .
perhaps . yes ! if we sent a low-level ionic pulse , it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems .
on screen .
beam them directly to sickbay .
there 's some buckling on the starboard nacelle . we 've also got a hull breach in the engineering section . emergency forcefields are in place and holding .
you 're in the nexus .
yeah . they 're great , aren 't they ? you can go back and see them born , go forward and see your grandchildren . time has no meaning here .
it 's our pleasure .
please , please .
oh , of course .
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair .
yes , yes , it is .
i 'm from what you would consider the future ; the 24th-century .
there 's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude !
i always do .
they 're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old klingon bird of prey is any match for the federation flagship .
too big . how long until the ribbon arrives ?
you may still . somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise .
yes . fine . if you 'll excuse me .
ever since i was a little boy , i remember hearing about the family line . the picards that fought at trafalgar , the picards that settled the first martian colony . when my brother married and had a son ...
mr. data , scan the planet for lifeforms .
there are no other ships in the system .
well , that narrows it to klingon , breen or romulan .
lock phasers and return fire !
right . and they 'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds . data , lock onto that plasma coil .
execute !
soon , captain ... quite soon .
mr. scott , we need everything you 've got now .
keep trying , chekov . at regular intervals .
short range scan , mr. chekov ... on screen , mr. sulu .
scotty ... ?
wait a minute ... ! we don 't know what we 're talking about here ...
i 'm sorry , sir . just don 't surrender . genesis doesn 't work ! i can 't believe they 'll kill us for it --
a photon tube ... !
and spock with it . they are joined together .
you said there wouldn 't be any .
yes , saavik , go ahead ...
i know , but -- let 's do it by the book . stand by on this channel . go .
we are under attack ! stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
scan for vessels in pursuit !
aye , sir !
very well . mr. chekov , i need pre-approach scan ... take the science station , please .
she 's to be decommissioned .
mr. scott : as good as your word .
fire , mr. scott !
go , sulu !
best speed to vulcan . mr. chekov , take the prisoners below .
saavik . send to ambassador sarek . tell him we 're coming in .
it 's been a while , sir . here we go ... retrothrusters !
approach control ... this is enterprise . ready for docking maneuver .
oh , i 'll have `` mr . adventure '' eating out of my hand . and i 'll see you at the rendezvous . all my hopes .
yes , my lord !
put him on screen ! study him well .
they 'll learn . galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young , doctor .
more antiques for your collection -- cheers !
i 'm your doctor and i 'm your friend , jim . get back your command . get it back before you really do grow old . before you turn into part of this collection .
the inspection will continue once we 're underway , doctor .
as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds .
this one looks like a steward . they 're not warm , but rigor hasn 't set in . this didn 't happen all that long ago , jim .
then this will be your big chance to get away from it all .
it 's like the garden of eden ...
i 'm taking this bunch to sick bay .
young . i feel young , doctor .
the matrix formed in a day . the life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate . can i cook or can 't i ?
starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years , i can not and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event .
i don 't understand . who 's responsible for all this ? who is khan ?
ssssh !
what do you want with us ? i demand --
she 's making it up ! my father was professor --
only half of you would get there .
it 's not much different from enterprise . when i was a guest aboard her some years ago , captain kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals . and now , mr. chekov , let us review : you say you have no details of project 'genesis ' ?
raise them --
rake her .
i shall avenge you --
uhura , send to commander , reliant : prepare to be boarded .
i 'm trying , sir . stand by ...
i say again . this is enterprise . please acknowledge signal . please --
he 'll die -- !
admiral , this is spock .
not at present .
to be sure , captain .
i 'd best talk with mr. scott , first so that he may , in his own words , explain the situation to his cadets .
it would explain a great many things --
at least we know he hasn 't got it . just keep nodding as though i 'm giving orders . saavik , punch up the data charts of reliant 's command console -- hurry ...
wait for my signal , spock -- too soon and he 'll have time to figure it out and raise them again .
uhura , patch me in --
or the one .
it is still regulation , admiral .
energize defense fields .
erased ...
on the test , sir , will you tell me what you did ? i 'd really like to know .
come , come , lieutenant , you of all people go by the book . hello , spock . you remember dr. marcus ...
at what .
aye , sir .
aye , sir --
engage warp engines --
visual .
scotty !
phasers locked ...
try again .
i 'll try , captain .
course heading , captain ?
aye , sir .
thank you , mr. saavik .
aye , sir .
gillian --
please ...
a moment alone , please .
spock , start your computations for time warp . come on , bones . let 's pay scotty a visit .
let 's hope so , bones . mr. sulu , set us down in golden gate park .
cramps .
come on , pavel ...
pavel , can you hear me ? give me your name and rank ...
not me , bones ... they did it .
hamlet , act i scene 4 .
no , spock . it means he feels safer about your `` guesses '' than most other peoples facts .
it is .
reading the patient 's vital signs .
that 's odd . uhura , what 's on the comm channels ... ?
stabilize energy reserve ! ... report helm :
mr. sulu , switch to manual control !
whoever said the human race was logical ? now if you 'll follow me , i 'll introduce you to the institute 's pride and joy .
you 're not one of those guys from the military , are you ? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes , or some dipshit stuff like that ?
is there something wrong with the one i have ?
well , that 's something . i'da let you off right here .
how did you know gracie 's pregnant ? nobody knows that .
it 's his way .
yes ... and i 'm glad you 're here . though i 'll admit , you picked a hellova time to drop in ...
a spaceship with a missing man .
calm yourself , nurse . scotty , get us out of here !
mr. sulu : full power descent !
and they will be again , spock . that 's the beauty of it . how much ?
admiral , if we were to assume these . whales are ours to do with as we please , we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction .
thank you , spock .
admiral , you must wait one damn minute .
hardly , admiral , i can not even guarantee we will escape the sun 's gravity ! i will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory .
weapons systems ?
continue on course . chekov , any signs of federation escort ?
picture , uhura !
ground cushion ! keep the nose up if you can --
aye , sir !
yes , sir .
on speakers .
right . now look : i want you all to be very careful . this is terra incognita . many customs will doubtless take us by surprise . it 's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before .
on screen .
sir ... estimating one nautical mile .
mr. scott -- how soon ?
out of control , and blind as a bat !
give me one more day , sir . the damage control is easy . reading klingon is hard .
mr. sulu ?
aye . but i 've never beamed up 400 tons before .
on my way ... !
scotty , don 't prejudge . a ship is a ship .
yes , admiral . sir . i have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son . david died most bravely . he saved spock . he saved us all ... i thought you should know .
i demand to see the owners ! i demand --
it 's not our custom to have guests here at all , let alone hold anyone against their will .
this way !
i thought it might begin the healing process .
bye .
they should be quarantined before joining the ship 's population .
how about a passive radiation scan ?
what possible purpose could a duplicate village have except ... to deceive the ba'ku ...
i don 't know .
good . let 's begin to move these people out ...
he 's right . our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies ...
picard 's first officer . do you really believe he 'll listen ?
in six hours , every living thing in this system will be dead or dying .
if you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated , the federation will pursue you until ...
if a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the federation what happened here , then i welcome it .
there 's nothing further to be gained from this ...
scan for lifesigns .
recommendations ?
no one hated them more than you , gal'na . we 've come a long way together . this is the moment we 've planned for so many years ...
do you have everything you need from command ?
i think it 's the universal greeting when you don 't like someone .
why not ?
eject the core .
remind me to lodge a protest ...
we 're through running from these bastards .
blow out the ramscoop . stand by full thrusters .
we 're not going anywhere .
aye , sir .
go back to your quarters that 's an order .
slow to impulse . we 're on our way .
beam him out !
prepare to enter the atmosphere ... we 'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him ...
picard to crusher ...
no . we 'll be responsible for that , mister worf .
accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jak'tahla ...
we have to find shelter ...
better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette ... something that goes well with chrysanthemums ...
good question .
i 'll be fine . he 's a different story .
at least four hours .
intelligence ... ambition ... desire ... i bring order to chaos ...
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference .
contact starfleet command .
i will admit ... there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off .
oh ... just a little tinkering . how is he ?
there should be an access hatch nearby ...
i have the password right here .
it could be the radiation , captain . try from the surface .
they used copper pipes in their plumbing ... so i melted it down ... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings . it 's not the strongest alloy ... but it 's better than all this crude aluminum and steel .
as they used to say ... all systems are go .
i 'm on it ...
well , i feel a whole lot better with them out there . we may need some help .
we 're crossing the threshold !
yes , he is .
don 't flatter yourself . i take pictures of a lot of junk .
aye , sir .
data , set a course for that vortex .
steady as she goes .
onscreen .
worf ... torpedo ... now !
what ?
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room .
they 're converting the deflector dish into an antennae ...
understood !
hold that thought .
any sign of data , or the borg themselves ?
commander ... we have a problem .
target ...
there were no planetary defense systems in this era . their weapons were designed to fight each other ... not extraterrestrials .
the charge is murder .
vulcans sleep lying down ...
we do sleep lying down .
thank you , nurse . jim , she 's ready ! lock and load !
i wish i knew . uhura ?
don 't remind me .
no way . you see this ?
killed trying to escape - it 's a classic ...
and perhaps with a large step or two . like a peace treaty .
in space , no one can hear you sweat .
if they did we 'd all have to turn ourselves in . how can we rely on them ?
aside from a touch of arthritis , i 'd say pretty good .
you say you are due for retirement . may i ask : do your hands shake ?
i 'm not sure how to take that .
very much .
your honors , the state rests .
full diplomatic courtesy , mr. chekov ...
i know what you mean ...
torpedo bay ! did we fire those torpedoes ?
aye , sir ; thrusters ...
onscreen .
we must do this again soon .
good enough for one - two would look suspicious ... killed while attempting escape ... now that 's convincing for both .
i like it here ...
don 't you know ? everyone on rura penthe is here for life .
energize ...
saavik , sir . we were told you 'd need a helmsman - ... so i volunteered .
you have personally -
... is to trust him .
control , this is enterprise requesting permission to depart .
not from a distance . she won 't show up on any type of scan .
what do you suggest , lieutenant ? opening fire won 't retrieve the captain ; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid .
i 'm having the garbage searched . if my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers ' necks like tiberian bats . they couldn 't make their escape without them ; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see ; no - they 're here . somewhere .
i do not think so . enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts . admiral donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed .
visual !
i know precisely where he 'll be .
thank you , mr. scott . we were to return to spacedock , the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear .
aye , aye , sir .
he 's placing himself in a most awkward position ...
at present , he 's surrounded by a magnetic shield . if my calculations are correct , he should be deep into his escape planning by this time .
maybe we should write them a letter ?
but you didn 't join a conspiracy .
i am in a room with lights .
can you describe it , deanna ?
thank you , data . let 's see what she can do .
aye , sir ... this way .
port thrusters , sir . would you like me to drive ?
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes .
divert power and compensate .
and i you .
this isn 't about me anymore .
no !
you sick bastard !
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes .
on screen .
what sort of signature ?
if you don 't mind .
not yet , mister worf .
who was it ?
on screen .
on my way . please notify commander riker .
acknowledged ... ... i 'll talk to data .
she 's a predator .
can anything be done for him ?
the honor was mine . captain riker .
no ?
praetor , we 've come to romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance . if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation , i suggest you do so now .
you 'll acquire a taste for it .
don 't be so vain . after we found it , we made a few modifications . an extra memory port , a hidden transponder . perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn i 've gained access to starfleet 's communications protocols . i now know the location of your entire fleet ... you may go .
on my way .
it is ... invigorating .
we 're being hailed .
have the doctors prepare . i 'll be on the bridge . '
seven minutes .
she is here .
none .
i don 't want to scare them away .
no , we can handle this .
we should have . let me see .
it is beautiful .
he 's got a gun ! !
what do you mean by 'contain ? '
oh shit ! ! !
watch it . they 're coming out .
no .
you better .
my ... ... car will take me ... ... up there ... home .
you keep this . now this is hitch- hike ... you stand on the side of the road , the highway ... you understand ? and you face the cars going in the direction you want to go . when you see a car or a truck coming , you stick out your thumb like this ...
tomorrow morning . start hitch-hiking right away and ...
it was a mistake .
you don 't make money gambling . you lose it .
many , many days and nights ...
no , thank you .
sure .
don 't worry . i 'll be all right .
i wouldn 't worry about it ... there might not be any little league tomorrow .
i did .
then why did they try and sneak in the back door ? tell me that . why didn 't they contact us first and say ...
wait 'll you see it .
joey , make sure mr. nero gets safely to his car .
you 're going down .
watch and see .
i just want to see what we 're like together through your eyes .
i just got to talk to you for one second .
no , lenny .
shutup a second !
w'sup , max ?
you may be a little overdressed for this party . yo , tick ! it 's lenny . open up !
i intend to .
this dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her , right ? but faith knows me from you , right , so she comes up to me and says , 'hey max why you following me ? ' i say , 'i 'll buy you a drink and explain . ' and she says ...
i do mean it . and i mean this ... if faith stays you go away and never come back . you scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again . you understand ?
they jerked my wheels , d'you believe it ? i mean it 's outrageous , the computer errors the banks are making lately . have you noticed ?
let 's talk in the car .
get it .
no idea .
this guy is someone you know , one of your squid-head contacts .
so some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around --
i need to see more ... get more detail . something . i feel his presence , so strong ...
easy , there , mom . easy . this is audio only . john coltrane . `` a love supreme . '' give it a listen , let me know what you think , maybe you won 't go for it now , but it 'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful .
it 's in my case . okay ? i 'm going to open my case ...
it 's okay , lenny they 'd never get here in time anyway .
fire 's out , isn 't it ?
yeah , me neither . it was one of my favorites . me and faith in a hot tub on my birthday . i 'm going to really miss it .
how long does it last ? oh .
why didn 't he just go public with the tape ? save himself that way .
good , lenny . i can see why the detective gig didn 't work out . come on .
exactly . that 's why it 's a make- able deal .
yeah . we did .
take the tape to the cops .
of course . he knows everything about dick low .
ten miles back on the texas side .
and it 's getting dark . i 'm not going to run this into the night . eddie , we 're walking in . everything covered ?
this is agent mackelway .
why me ? what do you want from me ! ?
go ahead .
where 's my watch ? it 's gone .
not yet . this time they 're waiting for you .
of course he does . now get the key , get these things off me . unhook me .
the little piggie speaks .
the file , however , was kept open after your death . npe disappearances , no plausible explanation , were sometimes filed there , deleted if the bodies were found .
lionheart here . i 'm back . sorry about the absence . i had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel .
something came up , murman , my man .
shut up .
i 'm sorry , i couldn 't help it . let me make it up to you .
hey , man . at least it 's disney .
... four days.. ?
don 't worry . he 's in good hands .
i 'm a `` dorothy '' .
sure , i guess . the phone 's in the back .
i understand .
listen , mike . you really didn 't have to get off the line . i just wanted to ask you one thing . i know i shouldn 't have called , i mean , my friends said i should wait two days ... oh god , i probably sound like such a schoolgirl ... it 's just that it 's tonight only ... i mean , it 's sinatra 's birthday and they have this thing every year at `` the room '' . do you know where that is ? it 's impossible to find if you 've never been there . i don 't understand why none of the clubs in hollywood have signs . anyway , i 'm so bad at this , if you 're not busy i thought you might ...
well , let 's hit that party .
i 'll be your winger .
no . just o.j .
don 't sweat it . now i got an l.a. gun story . you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home . he had an uzi . mike half-smiles .
you always know the right thing to say .
hey , man . i took the kings to the cup .
so , what ? eleven ?
... he 's derivative ...
damned if i know ...
i can 't believe you .
you asshole .
she 's really special , guys .
hi , nikki . this is mike . i met you tonight at the dresden . i , uh , just called to say i , uh , i 'm really glad we met and you should give me a call . so call me tomorrow , or , like , in two days , whatever . my number is 213- 555-4679 ...
hi , nikki . this is mike , again . i just called because it sounded like your machine might 've cut me off before i gave you my number , and also to say sorry for calling so late , but you were still there when i left the dresden , so i knew i 'd get your machine . anyway , my number is ...
213-555-4679 . that 's all . i just wanted to leave my number . i don 't want you to think i 'm weird , or desperate or something ... ... i mean , you know , we should just hang out . that 's it . no expectations . just , you know , hang out . bye .
i just got out of a six-year relationship . okay ? that should help to explain why i 'm acting so weird . it 's not you . it 's me . i just wanted to say that . sorry . this is mike .
hi , nikki . this is mike again . could you just call me when you get in ? i 'll be up for awhile , and i 'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all ...
hang on , voltaire .
it starts at eight ...
... through the kitchen ...
... it looked money .
we 're not messing with you ...
no , baby !
oh . he 's got it under control ...
... is he brown ?
... it 's on .
what was cold about it ?
... yeah .
you owe the don a service . in one hour , not before , perhaps later , he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help . be there to greet him . if you have any objections speak now , and i 'll inform him .
i want you to use all your powers , all your skill , as you love me . i do not want his mother to see him as he is .
i 'll come to you when i need you .
go back to your house and wait for me ...
shut up .
ok , ok. you gon na make me something to eat at least ?
ok , but be careful .
what are you , a dance judge ? go do your job ; take a walk around the neighborhood ... see everything is okay .
the guy at the gate 's outside ... says there 's a package ...
sure .
the senator called -- apologized for not coming personally , but said you 'd understand . also , some of the judges ... they 've all sent gifts . and another call from virgil sollozzo .
tom said he 'd take care of it .
how did you find out ?
no ... i would like to walk to corleone .
come sunday morning : my name is vitelli and my house is up there on the hill , above the village .
he had business at the hotel , but he 'll drop in for dinner .
no .
can you do it mike ?
we put out a lot of material through our contacts in the newspapers ... about mccluskey 's being tied up with sollozzo in the drug rackets ... things are starting to loosen up .
if i accept that letter and you told a court of law i accepted it , they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts . just wait kay , he 'll contact you .
mama , no .
i told you i had a lot of relatives .
my brother sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid , so my father took him in . he 's a good lawyer .
goodbye .
let her ask .
probably a year ...
maybe .
i do wish to be baptized .
you son of a bitch , you think you can brush me off like that ? i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders .
everybody should have one talent . what 's yours ?
you 're doing great . we 'll make a sailor of you yet . you 're doing really well .
hey , if i 'm late , think what her husband 's saying !
listen , just take one of mine when we get back . don 't worry about it . i did the forum with marge and , frankly , once is enough in anyone 's life .
marge , there 's female intuition , and then there are facts --
i 'm fine .
do you know tom ?
i 'll take them both .
okay then , you 're crazy .
where have you been since then ?
a roma , circa tre settimane fa .
you look ghastly , tom . are you okay ?
let her in , what 's the difference ? let her in . no , actually , no , i 'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later .
he 'll , what else can i do with it all ?
oh , i got over that . it was nothing , really . the papers always blow these things up . a little stiffness . that 'll go away . i just sleep more , that 's all .
thank you , travis .
now look more closely . look around the eyes and chin . see ? see there ?
ask travis . he 's the ladies man .
fuckin ' mau mau land , that 's what it is .
o.k . it 's a date . i 'll see you here , then .
where is home ?
i think you should go home , but otherwise i think you should go . it would be great for you . you have to get away from here . the city 's a sewer , you got ta get out of it .
thank you , sir . you 're a good man , sir .
shit , shit , shit what time is it . hello . i 'll be downstairs in ten minutes .
don 't let him do that .
what do you have , a fucking water pistol ? get him back !
name your vacation spot , goodspeed . the bureau 'll pay for it .
no . i 'm going to give you dancing lessons . what the fuck do you think ?
damn ...
mr. chairman , as i understand it , the fifth amendment pertains to self-incrimination , and i can 't incriminate myself because i 've done nothing wrong . besides , incrimination is why you have mr. clyde working for you .
go on home , folks . and thanks for the welcome .
well ... where can we go ?
yes . hic !
eventually . we were going to be engaged ... when you came back from overseas ...
the witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee , as long as it 's the truth .
ben , when 's delly due back ?
don 't mention it . welcome home , luke .
shhhhhh .
exactly . break it to her gently .
the bijou ?
i don 't know what else to tell you . i wasn 't hiding out . i hit my head and i didn 't remember anything until a few days ago .
mr. fitts , with all due respect , i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market . and i think lawson deserves the bijou . there 's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we 've all felt ...
can 't wait .
ah .
oh , no , i ...
six-thirty . i thought we 'd get an early start .
bought the bottle , didn 't i ? to the united states of america . long my she wave .
no , sir .
wish i could say the same thing .
sure . come on in . i was just packing .
i 'll have to think about this . i have to get back ... i should go ...
no , not really .
thank you .
yes , i did .
yes .
all right .
your brother told me .
that road can be a bad one at night , melanie .
is she all right ?
shhh . shhhhh .
it 's nothing .
birds are not bad !
stop worrying , deke . she was in a boat .
we 'll make our own fog .
a delivery , mother . miss daniels brought some birds from san francisco .
i 'll pick you up , miss daniels . where are you staying ?
i think he got a little scratch , mother .
you don 't know , you don 't know ! when will you know ? when we 're all dead ? like annie ?
i 'm sorry , mitch .
no , not exactly .
we know what it is , al .
eleven . in the middle of the party , some gulls came down at the children . and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after ...
now hold it , mitch . you don 't know that for a fact .
we 'll use smoke pots . like the army uses .
i 'm sorry . i couldn 't possibly ...
no , thank you .
at annie 's house . she 's all right .
i don 't want to be safe . i want to be with you .
no ... wait . hold me .
we 'll take it slow until we get to the main road . are you ready ?
i have no idea .
with smoke .
can we go on living here otherwise ?
you and mr. sholes seem to be implying as much .
... probably contain more than a hundred billion birds !
take it easy , lady . there isn 't a bird anywhere in sight .
all right , all right ! hope you figure this out , folks .
of course -- it 's the soul of the business -- the pay --
yes .
it 's not the failure . i feel that macfarlane has taught me nothing . he taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn 't teach me the poetry of medicine .
come -- it 's a chance to try out your bedside manner , fettes . take a look at the child .
from the municipal council -- they 're the bodies of paupers --
not if i have to be party to things like that , dr. macfarlane .
i 'm sorry for the woman , fettes . but her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens . as for me , fettes , i let no man stop me when i know i 'm right -- when i know that i need those lifeless subjects for my student 's enlightenment and for my own knowledge . and if you 're a real man and want to be a good doctor , you 'll see it as i see it .
this girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the highlands .
grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder .
who would believe that ? and you know , someone else might recognize her . she was as well known as the castle rock .
no room there . we 'll have to set it between us .
i am not at the school anymore . i left last night .
i wanted to see the white horse --
medicine ? that 'll keep . sit down .
you will not have it ?
that 's a good boy , toddy .
would you grudge me a glass with my old crony , meg ?
we have never been friends .
but then i wouldn 't have the fun of having you come here and beg again , toddy .
that was hare 's end . ah , you should have seen him on the streets , when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her !
i 'll show you how it was done , joseph . -- i 'll show you how they `` burked '' them .
perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed . i 'm sure it could be -- i could incise the columna dorsi --
he must leave me alone .
aye .
i 'm not dying for your goddamn illusions . you got that ? you think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you ? bullshit . she was already bored , why do you think she was looking around ? you 're nothing , corvis ! less than nothing .
i guess it 's true . guns don 't kill people ...
bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg . if she ' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened . so you 're right , spooky . happy ?
nobody .
yeah , i know .
i don 't want to see !
no matter what happens ... you 're innocent ... i promise ...
the dead can return , given sufficient motivation . and corvis has that .
he 's looking for something . won 't stop until he finds it . sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want .
you two are majorly demented . anyone ever tell you that ?
you killed my daughter .
looks like you have them both on .
boy , we had a swell time . didn 't we , mr. carpenter ?
okay .
come on , darling -- we 're going up to bed .
no -- i want to take you to the movies . do you think they 'd accept these ?
mr. brady 's a cop .
yeah -- sure . it 's a real boy scout flashlight .
why -- the light in my room went out . thank you , bobby . goodnight .
from another planet . let 's just say that we 're neighbors .
i 'm sorry . i guess i 'm just tired of hearing about mr. carpenter . i don 't like the way he 's attached himself to you and bobby . after all , what do you know about him ?
come on in .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
goodnight , mr. carpenter .
goodnight , my dear .
i can see no other hope for your planet . if the meeting should fail , then i 'm afraid there is no hope .
get going , will you , brady -- before i get mad !
this one could save your life .
it 's a pretty cool place if you 're a martian .
you better get some fresh air .
exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed ?
you don 't have to beat me , michael . just try to keep up .
good idea . marko . we 're hungry .
no . stick around .
now i get it ... you 're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money . you 're part of a cult .
i can 't do that !
how do you know they 're not ?
to free you , we must destroy the leader of the vampires .
that 's exactly what this place is . one great big coffin . let 's stake 'em .
sam , don 't --
it 's called the indian walk . walkin ' without makin ' a sound .
soon .
c'mere , nanook .
must be a circuit breaker .
i hope so .
it 's you i was after all along , lucy . to be our day time guardian . i knew if we could bring sam and michael into the faimly , there 'd be no way you could say no .
okay , sam . thanks .
sort of . we used to come here summers when i was kid . now we 're here on a permanent basis .
okay .
okay .
you 're not going anywhere ... sam ...
so do i !
mom , just give me five more minutes . just five minutes , okay ?
come on , sam , you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean . '
don 't bother .
i don 't know .
huh ? ...
just listen .
screw it , i 'm going up anyway .
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce , whatever it ate or absorbed , cell for cell .
ah ... he was hurt bad . bullet nicked an artery ... i don 't know ... an hour ... hour and a half ...
nothing . nothing at all .
i just can 't comprehend any of this . it was just a dog .
if the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- i 'm sending you and doc up to macmurdo ...
ain 't it there ?
cut , bullshit . been pulled apart .
if it did get to him .
am i starting to look norwegian to you , bwana ?
clark , you want me to come in after you ? !
that 's good enough .
how the fuck do i know ? !
we got morphine , don 't we .
cut the bullshit ... okay , sanchez , you come with us . norris ... you stay here ... any of them move -- you fry 'em . and if you hear anything , anything at all you let loose the siren . we all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless . and everybody watch whoever you 're with . real close .
now copper , you tie palmer up .
so , i don 't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down .
come on , copper .
i guess i 'm the only one .
damn you , macready !
could be anything ... men in isolation ... some beef that snowballed ... got out of hand ...
well , stick with it . i want you at it round the clock . we got to get help in here ...
i am going after them .
could anyone have gotten it from you ?
damn if i won 't .
thought you 'd feel that way , garry . you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma ... ... we 'll do you last ...
then get a move on . childs , come with me .
move it , palmer .
mac , where the hell is that pump ! !
i ain 't going with sanchez .
it 'll come . it needs us . we 're the only thing left to imitate ... give me a hand .
i 'm going to blow the generator when you get back . he 'll have to come for us -- or freeze .
anyplace but here .
who else could have used that key ?
the journey is part of my work .
i am called vox ... ... now you are eloi .
i 'm a foolish man .
hold on ... i know i have it ...
i want to get into the light , that 's all . please ...
i 've seen it .
how romantic ...
perseverance .
that 's where you 're wrong . i will change it .
i pray to god that in a week you 're not here .
all right , all right -- here -- everything --
yes ...
some . but i mean we aren 't all so ... handsome .
thank you ...
i suppose so .
dean fulton ...
what 's it like where you come from ?
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb .
for our sake , i hope not .
don 't give me that . i know what 's real , goddamnit ! you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer .
maybe not . [ beat ] but i do think you 're in a tree ... woofing like a dog . and i 'm just trying to help you the only way i can think of .
sit down , mr. starks ! sit down , mr. starks !
you in here . [ beat ] works like a drug .
you may have known my father , william starks .
oh yeah , what 'd he say ?
they should just be looking harder .
i am . one of the few things i remember doing is eating . so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams .
yeah , i 'll hitch a ride or something . [ beat ] let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel .
william starks . [ beat ] thanks .
after i ...
there 're no cars on this street .
because your body can only take so much of what they 're putting you through .
ok .
i see you 've done your homework . [ beat ] alpine grove 's undergone a lot of changes since then . at the time , we didn 't have the ... resources to help our patients the way we needed to . [ beat ] now , we do . and things are different .
i 'll die either way .
maybe .
you told me about him . i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him . so you told me .
what for ?
or just plain stupid . you 'd think by the twentieth time , i 'd have found an alternative method . maybe a more effective one , if you know what i mean .
why ?
is it true ?
you know what ? it 's christmas eve . and you look clean -- i mean , you 're normal-looking . [ resolutely , for her own benefit ] it 's christmas eve , and i have a couch .
thanks .
maybe . [ beat ] maybe not .
see ya .
no you won 't . you 'll be back today . now ! you get your ass back here , thelma , now , goddamnit . thelma , do you understand me ?
well , son , she 's doin ' a damn sight better 'n you right now .
i know ! i 'd tell you if i knew ! goddamn ! i know something happened , or she wouldn 't have left . i 'm trying to remember everything ! find that fucking kid . he probably knows something .
it 's him .
you do ? is he a funny uncle ? 'cause if he is , then he and i got somethin ' in common .
yeah , you 're startin ' to feel pretty good to me , too .
shut up .
human nature . i 'm majoring in behavioral science .
darryl , that 's my husband , he says he 's not ready . he 's still too much of a kid himself . he prides himself on being infantile .
maybe .
believe me , the last thing i want is for you to get punished .
you wan na let me see your license , please ?
oh yeah .
isn 't this fun ?
west . left .
i don 't know , thelma ! i don 't know ! just shut up a minute so i can think .
thelma kinda took to him .
they think we like it . maybe they think it turns us on .
let 's get it over with .
what .
we should have just ignored him .
yes .
are you alright ?
texas ... you were right about what happened to me there .
it 's the goddamn grand canyon !
it 's grand !
all this for us ?
yeah . i been seein ' you , too .
you know good and damn well what i 'm talkin ' about .
fuck you .
jeez , i didn 't catch it .
christ , ted , i was only four towns away .
fuck calling her . i 'm going down there .
flew . told my wife i was going to a promise keepers convention .
no ! you 've gone through way too much to back down now . get over there and do something -- i can 't stand watching this .
i 'm an orthopedic surgeon , she 's an orthopedic surgeon .
who ?
loser ? woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class .
you got a brew ?
no , thanks . love a little bundt cake if you have some !
aw , christ , i can 't take it anymore . i 'm gon na pack my bags and go back to my own place .
i don 't know . i guess ... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on peace corp wages .
thanks .
no thanks .
thanks .
great .
who the hell 's woogie ?
really ? very , very ?
i 'd say about a deuce , deuce and a half . not bad .
why the fuck would i do that ? i 'd be screwing myself .
same here .
oh look , it 's doob ! will you excuse me a minute , tucker ?
who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me ? !
maybe this 'll jog your memory .
ugh , not pecs . sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock .
all right for awhile ? the guy 's good- looking , rich , witty . he was a god .
i don 't want someone who 'll put up with him . i want someone who will enjoy him , the way i do . do you know what he told my friend tucker ? he said he would 've popped the question a lot earlier if warren wasn 't in my life . well he is in my life and i 'm goddamn lucky to have him . the hell with steve .
healy .
i can 't do it -- i just found out it 's his birthday . i guess i 've got ta cancel on ted .
hey , no kidding ? where are your offices ?
where would i have seen your work ?
no no , the bigger the better . but i must say , they could be a little brighter . nothing 's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites .
well that 's what i 'm trying to figure out . how long have you known him ?
oh jesus ...
a real clydesdale , huh warren ?
you betcha !
who 's that ?
funny story . you see , me and a buddy of mine decided to ... ah ... you know ... just ... drive down .
no short game .
that 's more like it . two more nitrate-sicles please .
ah , my roots here are too deep . i love my practice , the people i work with , warren 's got a nice thing going why don 't you just move down here and marry me ?
toy poodle !
you 're woogie ?
you forgot your keys !
i was playing a trick . i-i-i had a baseball .
i wish .
i think a little of both .
no , that 's really unneces --
i think i was very clear , ted . if everything else falls apart , maybe .
giddy-up .
what --
that 's all well and good , but what do we say to 'em ?
doesn 't matter to me . if i went down in history like adams , i 'd die happy . all they say about him today is --
give it a rest . you were thinking the same thing , just didn 't have the guts to take the heat .
something your father would 've come up with .
he better . because nobody thinks he 's up to this . nobody .
no , ken . i need to see him now ...
i just checked myself . they 're being issued identity cards . call comes , and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas . they go by helicopter to mount weather . we meet them there .
i think it 's a bad idea .
says what , kenny ?
yes , sir . our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational . the invasion happens eight days later .
we 've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise , sir . we 're looking at another week and a half , mr. president .
yeah .
i , uh ...
today , for your information , is pulaski day . we 're going to buffalo ...
not as far as the election goes .
cheer up , you 've neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day .
they want this fucking job , they can have it . it 's no great joy to me .
of course it is . but the president needs to realize we 're going to have to stop a ship eventually .
six months from now , i 'm not going to care . are you ? we 'll deal with it .
sleep is for the weak , mr. president .
i 'm afraid not , mr. president . the sub has positioned itself between the pierce and the soviet ships . admiral anderson insists it 's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters . the pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub .
you ain 't gon na cut his hands off and send 'em to washinton , are ya ? they done that to one of our girls once . leo did quillwork , he 's gon na need his hands .
his mother needs a piece of his hair . it 's for the keeping of the souls ceremony . has to be kept for four days .
no , ray . you 're gon na have to blame that on your grandmother .
ray .
we 'll have to give leo a refund . because he 's got ta go to the m.e . in case you don 't know , officer , violation of the major crimes act on --
i think leo 's retired from quillwork for the moment .
beats the hell outta me .
ray levoi , sir . pleasure .
cooch . you 're my hero .
that 's right .
a long way from home . you be careful out there .
whoever dusted leo , dusted him from the driver 's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands . jimmy looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car . it 's a known fact out here that he 's petrified of driving . his parents were killed in a car wreck .
yes .
no way , cooch .
after we 've completed our investigation .
-- leo wasn 't killed here . he was dumped here . out of a vehicle . bald tread . muffler held on with baling wire .
let 's go .
medicine . as in medicine man ?
good question . hardly sees anybody anymore . hasn 't left this place in twenty years . did you bring some tobacco ?
sacred herbs . tobacco . don 't worry , we don 't smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe . that 's a white man 's myth . this is a sacrament .
a what ?
likewise .
no . i was sent here cuz i 'm indian . and a good cop .
we 're going for the stronghold .
you didn 't have another vision ...
no . my father never told anybody he had indian blood . but he still used a few indian words around the house . he called me washee . said it meant ... good boy .
black tail district , x22 . you ready for this ? leo wasn 't killed in the badlands . i ... i found the location .
i 'm on my way back in . over .
yellow bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning . some gung-ho agent from d.c. pushed him into a corner . you 're playing a losing game . pull over .
-- yes , teton sioux . father 's side .
i 'm with someone .
yeow !
yes , ma'am , at first . then i was directly above him .
i was inverted .
no sir ! but you have to be ready .
these guys are getting on my nerves .
breaking left !
okay .
pay no attention to it . they 're just trying to rattle you . it 's all psychological . sit down..and drink .
on your six -- coming hard . four hundred . losing airspeed ! he 's on your six and closing fast ! hard left ! hard left !
right .
bogey at three o'clock high ! nose on !
wood 's okay . i want viper .
go ahead . i can 't reach . 2000 feet !
come on . i died enough for one night .
don 't .
was .
he 's a hell of a flyer . in fact , he 's so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself . except for one thing . he just can 't seem to follow orders !
thirty seconds . that 's all it took to blow us out of the sky .
got 'em .
no , no , no , he 's mine .
no , i got him . i can take him .
look out !
tell me one thing .
me ?
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane !
my first squadron in vietnam , we lost eight out of eighteen planes . ten guys . the first one kills you , but there 'll be others -- you can count on it .
he ain 't got five kids to feed .
take me to the hotel .
hey , i got four kids to feed .
thank you .
may i use your pen ?
not true , he 's one of my best friends ... he 's got a big house and a mercedes . and you like melina , right ? well , you 'll get to fuck her every night. -- that 's right . she 's gon na be hauser 's babe .
don 't be an idiot .
looks like another schizoid embolism .
nice to meet you .
i 'm quite serious . you 're not here , and neither am i .
swallow this .
relax , you 'll live longer .
melina !
well don 't .
i 've got quaid .
i 've got him . the guy in the turban .
split up . find him .
up !
come on !
drive ! drive ! !
anywhere ! go ! ..just go -- oh shit ! ! shit ! !
but i 'm always home by morning .
i 'm late .
bye .
no ! spies or something . and harry from work ... get down !
doug ...
i 'm here at rekall .
doug , don 't !
aaah , let me tantalize you . you 're a top operative , back under deep cover on your most important mission . people are trying to kill you left and right . you meet a beautiful , exotic woman ...
if cohaagen wants you dead , you might be okay .
kuato wants to see you . come on !
i 'm not a hooker ! that 's my cover .
i 'm not sure dear ? what do you think ?
of course not . if mars had an atmosphere , he 's lose control .
some kind of mutation ... ?
phone 's out . road 's out . we 're on our own .
yeah , whatever they are , you 'd think after they ate all those sheep they 'd have to take a dump someplace ... what the hell 's going on in town ?
damn ! val , we can 't get them . never figured on having to shoot through dirt ! best goddamn bullet stop there is . come back .
i 'd go for penetration . the 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway .
you 're never going to believe this , but the canyon road ... we were on it not two hours ago ... well , it 's completely ...
in a minute .
damn it ! they 'll sink this rig just like a boat !
probably couldn 't move too easily on the surface .
the mountains are solid granite . we 'd be safe there , and we could hike along them ... all the way to bixby if we have to .
no good . you need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail .
val , stop ! they 're coming ! don 't move !
no . we go straight .
nope , there ! that 's one .
has a lot of rain .
do not talk to the driver .
right . we plan ahead . that way we don 't do anything right now . earl explained it to me .
forget it , man . it 's not worth it .
damn straight ! now there 's nothing between us and bixby but nothing !
yeah ! next time i tell you i 'm not hung up ... !
the rifle .
then where 's the goddamn conway twitty coming from ?
oh shit !
yeah . where 's your truck ?
okay , now , how far 's your truck ?
first let 's see if stumpy 's still out there .
well , that 's why edgar never got down off that tower .
right .
right . we need to be talking about what we 're gon na do .
i 'm gon na help you .
chuck him out the door ! like a little hors d'oeuvre .
jesus , val , it 's pretty far .
not going to pole vault anywhere . that 's for sure .
hey , just 'cause you 're no good with a rope ...
i got a goddamn plan ! !
not yet , not yet ...
she just practically asked you for a date . what the hell is wrong ? !
ran into the new college student , rona .
yeah , heather , we got you .
it 's ... gone ... !
am i sure ? ! it was right there . there 's the cord .
god , what a stink !
could be .
let 's assume that it is .
yes , see , they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials ... ... the dirt ... the loose soil that makes up the valley floor . but they can 't move through solid rock . i think we should travel west to the mountains .
it does .
let 's do it !
an hour after you picked it up !
i know about esparza .
no it is not , mr. dowd .
complain to the bar commission .
i suppose i could find an inmate who 'd say that shu boasted about chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn 't really do it ...
i would like to put shu 's alleged crime in a context , your honor . and we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room ... if it please the court , i 'd like to call mr. reynard .
no further questions .
look -- i 'm tired , i 'll see you in the morning , eddie .
with two knives taped to his hands ? forget it , rog .
eddie ... i don 't know about this ...
`` have to '' ? no ...
saving it for the sunday times .
-- you found his mugshot ?
christ ... shu is innocent .
neither .
and i call your testimony hearsay . i have no more questions for you .
a number of them are dead , three are in prison , one 's a waiter ... two -- you 'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the chamber of commerce .
exactly !
`` painted '' ?
it 's okay , eddie .
when i joined up i took an oath of secrecy . i told you what you needed to know .
by trusting me . shit , man ...
good . now we 're going to take an affadavit from you , but only concerning the facts of the chinatown shooting . we honestly don 't give a shit about the kennedy assassination .
mr. rabin has no right to --
i 'd need a continuance . three weeks at least .
and who was arturo esparza ?
-- what trial ?
no ! they g-got the wrong guy ! i saw it ! the killer wasn 't chinese .
no ! god , no ...
bobby ... ssshhhh ... you killed mike .
bobby ...
we 've got our own clock . we 'll lock up .
yep , it sure is .
not a lot around here , no . got some clubs , but not very many fellas with balls .
that 's alright . i was having a bad dream . i was dreamin ' about a joke with no punchline .
i think i 'll take off my badge as well .
your surprise , chet . her name is lil .
no , sir , we did not .
oh .
i 'll get my kit .
i 'm just too adorable . i 'm just too adorable .
laura , aren 't you going to fix me a drink ?
yes you do , donna . what a downer you are ! ! !
not you , donna , not you .
brother , i hear you talkin ' .
mom , take it easy .
yes .
stay away from me .
look at this finger here .
oh , i 'll sit down , but none of us are going to start eating till laura goes and washes her hands .
frank galvin 's ... who 's calling please ? bishop brophy 's office ...
it 's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...
no . no . thank you . you go home .
that 's perfectly all right . i 'm kind of rushed . do you mind if we walk while we talk ?
what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party ... ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge ...
... and i have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field ... there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor 's negligent ...
thanks , franky .
so what do you want me to do ? concannon 's going to try the case his way , i 'm going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he 's got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . i 'm going to win this case .
we got to talk .
come on , we 'll get a cup of coffee ...
come on out ! we 're friends !
all right - i 've seen enough !
he 's top man in astro and nuclear physics . he knows all about meteors !
there 's only about one explanation for a thing like this..got a pin ?
automobile ignitions are insulated .
no . the air 's going to be full of jets in a minute ... and there they are !
i bought it for the square dance . i thought i ought to wear some- thing western .
but you 're not going to . you 're not the kind . you 're tired , anyway . you 've been up all night . you cracked up in a plane . slept in a ditch . but you want to know something ? it doesn 't show on you at all .
it 's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down .
it was nearer than that .
there 's a square dance at the social hall this evening .
i 've done about all i can do here . you go back in . sylvia - i like that doctor forrester . he 's a good man .
everything human don 't have to look like you and me ... .
welcome to california !
sure , sure ! everybody understands you wave the white flag , you wan na be friends .
i 'm sorry . at least we 're in on piece .
maybe you should tell me your dream .
forget those two clowns , heather . answer me , did you get another call from that guy or not ?
absolutely .
bye .
they were safe and could sleep .
don 't let the bedbugs bite .
not sleepy .
you 've got to sleep , dylan , you ...
trying to get up ... trying to get into our world .
no , i don 't think so . you just have to ... pray , or reach ...
promise . cross my heart . but until mommy gets back , dylan , whatever you do , don 't fall asleep .
coming for you ...
here .
read me some ?
just because it 's a love story doesn 't mean it can 't have a decapitation or two .
kids know when something 's bugging a parent . you 've got no idea who this is calling ?
steady ...
they wouldn 't let me ...
i think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress .
exactly . the problem comes when the story dies . it happens a lot of different ways , the story gets too familiar , or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell , or ti 's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned . however it happens , when the story dies , the evil is set free .
current version . for ten years he 's been imprisoned as freddy by the story of nightmare on elm street . but now that the films have stopped- the genie 's out of the bottle , heather , that 's what the nightmares are about . that 's what i 'm writing .
it 's time these boys saw some real blue water .
mr. lawford , stand by to ease the mainsheet . rick , get on the jib sheet . george , john , philip , tim and dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse . george will show you what to do . tod , show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines . forecourse first ... work upward .
watch the tell-tales chuck . if we jibe now we 'll have a lot of people in the water .
everybody down ! on the double ! !
it was an act of god for christ 's sake .
okay .
what ?
yes you could . you did . this is all you . nobody else .
it was a bad dream ...
shut up , phil .
like this !
i know you will .
maybe it 's an air raid .
what are you talking about .
face what ?
he killed the dolphin .
i thought we 'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails .
oh , on the contrary , the albatross is considered a very good omen . it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on . it 's very bad luck if you kill one . and dolphins too .
i know .
he 's a big boy .
well , we 've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony .
she 's cuban .
lem me go ! lem me go ! !
come on , he didn 't mean anything .
shut up donut .
like you 'd know what to do with one .
look , save it for somebody else will ya . this ancient shit doesn 't have anything to do with me .
nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere .
no self respecting shark is gon na take a bite out of you .
what ?
no , phil . it 's a mammal .
long enough .
you already have . now go on . do it .
no . i didn 't .
like takin ' candy from a fuckin ' baby ...
muchas gracias .
whattaya do there ?
yes . mr. san pedro sula spoke yesterday to his son , archibald leach san pedro sula , who is named after cary grant , and he told them there was a shooting .
call me johnnie ... n.o . has always been a good town to sit around in .
do you know honduras , johnny ?
united states marine issue , before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters . i have it here , in my briefcase .
we are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen .
johnnie , please . nope . charlotte , north carolina . here on business .
the real joke is we never went fishing , but we 're still fishing .
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindu 's lifetime to unfix ... you better get a move on , johnnie , before that boy got her holdin ' down a memphis streetcorner and shootin ' dope up her arms .
i 'll be damned if that wasn 't a wrong number ?
what i made you do , mama ?
thinkin ' a second , baby .
grandmama pace had a long , smooth white neck . it was like on a statue it was so white ?
i can 't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth .
no , he picked me up .
that 's good ... now go get yourself a beer . you fellas have alotta the same power elvis had ... y'all know this one ?
looks more like the ghost of the old south , but we 'll try her .
i don 't know , honey , but we got ta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on i broke parole .
not quite as bad as the weather though ... it must be a hundred and ten and it ain 't even noon yet .
no radio or tv ...
the only one .
no , i don 't think so , sail . i just need to lie down .
well , nothin ' personal , but i ain 't sure it 's okay by me .
few beers is all . feelin ' any better ?
lead the way .
we 're going to the men 's room . only we might not make it in time .
we 're springing you , leer . get some pants on .
yeah , between a bookie and a pair of broken legs .
shut up and drink .
just go around him .
where would we go ?
tripp , where the hell ...
call it a hunch .
oh , right . oola . about that jacket ...
gee , i don 't know , crabs ... improvise . you 're good at that .
i peeked .
hey , jeff . if you 're really interested in discussing that business with the tango , try the guy at the end of the hall .
shoot .
... you carry firearms .
like the lady herself .
is he all right ?
mmrrmmm ... knap sap !
yeah , well , actually ...
smoke the rest of that joint , james , and you can start on the box .
she came here . we 'll just wait . in the meantime , i need you to shimmy through .
i know . it 's the house you want to wake up in on christmas morning . make yourself at home . i 'll be right back .
i don 't know , james . i don 't know why i do half the things i do . who does ? why do you wear that coat ?
okay .
it 's walter 's dog and yes , she does know . but let 's spare her the details . come on , your shoes are in the hail .
james 'll know about george sanders .
oh . well . i ...
i guess you 're going to have to chew it off then .
totally . i 'm sorry . a lot was happening this morning . can you talk ?
in the hospital . i was kind of excited about it at the time , but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers .
i know , but sometimes ...
he 's still barking at me . he 's blind .
it 's a bathtub . what she 's standing under .
oh ... yeah .
taking the long way home .
only when i 'm working .
well , i 'm sure with the proper guidance he 'll be fine .
no , i 'm going ho --
seems like the whole world 's gotten younger .
i just recommended you . you still had to prove yourself .
k through sixth .
yeah . it 's really nice .
sure .
it 's a bright sound .
it 's my bird book .
robin .
'fraid not .
you are in .
if she 's here tomorrow , i 'll fucking kill her .
okay . eyes closed , mind a blank . i 'm all yours . do it , rosen .
i thought you were a dyke .
sorry .
not tonight .
because i like you .
how many girls did you molest ?
no . never again .
fine .
everyone needs a plant . this ivy is one tough baby . it 's a cutting from one of mine .
not when they fly .
i told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked asap .
piece of cake , baby .
no way that could just be seawater .
yeah , yeah ... yeah . it 's turning .
folks , i 've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig .
figured i was dead , there , when i seen that angel comin ' toward me .
not for long .
not particularly . jeez , look where this is set ! morons .
that must be it .
i don 't know . divorce ain 't final . forgot to take it off .
cute , virgil .
i can get power to this module and sub-bay if i remote these busses . i 've got ta get past the mains , which are a total melt-down .
yeah ? well i 'm not .
can we negotiate later ? there 's big geek .
you noticed .
somewhere behind this panel . hold this .
tell me later .
who then ?
let 's go , guys .
monk , schoenick ... secure the package .
check . then i just hang with these guys , right ?
now we 're right in the middle of this big-time international incident . like the cuban missile crisis or something .
yeah . the dude 's in bad shape ... you see his hands ?
that 's cause we love freezin ' our butts off out here sooo much , boss .
i can 't ... make it ... podner .
missed what ?
out blood oughta be fizzin ' like a warm , shook- up coke .
now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender .
right on ! hot rods of the gods . right , lins ? hey , no really ! it could be ntis . the cia has known about them for years . they abduct people all the time . there was this woman i knew in albuquerque who --
just checking is out , huh ? how come ?
just hold your water , okay ? so kirkhill , we gon na do this or we gon na talk about it ?
the magnetometer is pegged . side-scan is showing a big return , but i don 't see anything yet . are you sure you got the depth right on this ?
gotcha , cab three . who is that ? that you , lindsey ?
we got russian subs creeping around . shit ! something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here , man . give our folks medals , know what i mean ?
that guy 's crazier'n a shithouse rat !
shut up , hippy . bud , how you doing ?
bud , according to monk here , you just set a record for the deepest suit dive . bet you didn 't think you 'd be doing this when you got up this morning .
bud , it 's the pressure . try to concentrate . concentrate on my voice . just listen to my voice .
she 'll wait .
wait for what ?
what ! after giving us such a run around ...
it takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from lisca bianca .
that seems to apply to you also ...
and that 's what i say , too . we could have all been killed .
oh , no ... please ... not here . it looks too dangerous .
yes , maybe that is better .
as soon as you 're ready , you can come down and catch up with me . i 'll be waiting for you right outside on the square .
so , you wonder why ?
okay . in a few minutes .
nothing .
calm ? ... he doesn 't seem so to me ... he was awake all night .
it was futile . we went all over .
quieter ? oh , yes , of course .
but why all nudes ?
i think all you have to do , giulia , is to close the door .
i detest comparisons made with oil .
you must know your third grade geography book inside out .
please , giulia ; must you always emphasize the obvious ? i can see for myself that the weather is changing .
when one approaches fifty , my dear , he is affected only by the cold .
we 'll try again .
it wouldn 't really do you any harm to skip a meal .
yes , we will .
i detest it . but , after all , what can you do ... it 's the latest ... and i try my best to adapt myself .
claudia isn 't coming with us . will you please take care of her luggage ? thanks .
oh , it 's even more wonderful then .
thanks ...
look there are a lot of unanswered questions here .
answers .
no ... no ... i said leave her alone .
wasn 't it !
eh ... don 't call him sir , he 's got enough delusions of power as it is .
no . i don 't .
i suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it .
you crawler .
if i let you have your own way , you little rascal , will you respect me ?
get in there , paul , she 's weakening .
he comes from a large family .
what do you expect from an ad lib ... raymond chandler ?
i 'll look in here again .
well , it must be catching . he 's given it to the champ here .
you see , sly villains .
i 'll look after meself .
before you go , i think it 's only fair to warn you about me grandson ... don 't let our paul have his own way all the time , 'cos if you do he won 't respect you !
every morning .
who are these ruffians ? ... i 've never seen them before in my life ! ...
don 't dramatise .
here , pauly .
you 're undressed . where are your clothes ?
aye , come on , honest , that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot .
oh yeah , he 's very clean , y'know .
aye , before anyone stops us .
so 's mine .
you 're a swine , isn 't he george ?
he started it .
hello the income tax have caught up with us at last .
well you 're not going .
oh shurrup and come on john . they 're waiting for you in the studio .
sit down , the lot of you .
gear ! come on , girls , let 's have a bit of a dance .
aye , let 's try the dressing room .
well , that 's just your opinion . do i snore , paul ?
aah , shurrup , misery !
since you ask , yes . aah , come on , ring , we love you .
good lad , ringo .
someone put it on me .
well , you don 't have to rub me nose in it . i 've a good mind to ...
that 's too easy for lennon .
yeah , it 's all your fault , getting invites to gambling clubs . he 's probably in the middle of an orgy by now .
you were twanging too loud .
get knotted !
oh , him ... he 's been lurking .
or something will be able to see us .
not sitting on our butts in here , that 's for sure .
dell , plot our location .
that 's what i 'm going to do .
receiving .
unknown .
it is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man .
has the hull been breached ?
what was that ? what the christ was that ?
the water will still recycle .
here , let me try .
just hold us together till we 're in space , that 's all !
i hope not .
poison gas ...
it 's eating a hole in the floor !
isn 't there some way we can get it off him ?
you can 't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits ...
we 'd be sitting ducks in the freezers .
ask him .
careful , don 't get under it !
i 'll come with you .
the door was closed . it must still be in here .
whoever 's doing the herding is gon na have their hands pretty full . i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it 's inside , and to serve as ... as ...
let me go first ; you stay behind me .
i guess i had it coming . let 's call it settled .
it doesn 't make any sense . it paralyzes him ... puts him into a coma ... then keeps him alive .
the same thing must 've happened to the creatures on the other ship ... except they took one of those jars on board , and opened it there .
it was horrible -- horrible . like a chicken .
you will notice , though , that there are no more phases . only four forms are shown . after that the pattern repeats .
hey look , somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat !
feast your eyes .
sorry . nothing but that same damn transmission , every 32 seconds . i 've tried every frequency on the spectrum .
that creature sure must have considered it important ... using his last strength to draw it ...
help me -- i 'm going to try to get it off .
let 's let the machine work on him .
we 're going into the freezers now .
we 'll have to trap it somehow . if we had a really strong piece of net , we could bag it .
just a second . those aren 't water vapor clouds ; they have no moisture content .
close ...
tell you what , martin . as soon as the engine 's fixed --
good .
is that its mouth ?
they seem native to the planet . it 's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity . it 's dead now , but once it must have been fertile .
go ahead , jay .
let 's be democratic .
that kind of remark is pointless . now come on -- i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with , no matter how wild .
doesn 't matter -- we 're already at light speed . and when we get back to the colonies , they 'll pick us up in the network .
sure .
well , just keep looking . it 's got ta be ... whoa , jesus !
bloody big if it is . top 's open .
wait a minute .
okay , give me the numbers .
too many .
keep trying !
that 's impossible , man . this fence is high-tensile . the breaking tolerance 'd stand up to the strain of a rhino , easy . i know , i put it up .
hey , fair enough . if you won 't come , i 'll handle it myself .
yeah , i ...
thanks .
just give them the facts . they can leap to their own conclusions .
what is that ?
looks like it .
forget it . i wouldn 't ask somebody to do something i wouldn 't do myself . where 's the disk ?
right . when you 've done that , don 't waste any time getting out of there . once that crane starts moving ... well , it 's bound to provoke some kind of response .
right . auto-shop , you all set ?
blow those suckers , driscoll !
what do i think ? i think if those marines from powell don 't shift their butts getting here , we 're gon na get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn 't .
max is paying for it . he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted ... well . can i fix you a drink ?
answer my question ! weren 't you paid to get out of town ?
very well . i shall drop you and go on to the party . i have no intention of missing it ...
you have me confused with dan dailey . you go sit by the piano . and you come sit by me . good night .
miss caswell is an actress . a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts . ah ... eve .
that 's all television is , my dear . nothing but auditions .
and too many of them are produced .
hear , hear ...
amen .
maybe just a little around the edges .
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten- - and you 're going to be on time .
i 'm a junk yard .
and who remembered it ? who was there on the dot , at twelve midnight ... ?
that suddenly makes the whole thing believable .
glory hallelujah .
the point is - in the cathedral , a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends .
a foursquare , upright , downright , forthright married lady ... that 's for me . and no more make believe ! off stage or on ... remember , lloyd . i mean it , now . grown-up women only , i might even play a mother - only one child , of course , not over eight ... lloyd , will you promise not to be angry with me ?
eve . eve harrington .
i told you a lie . we 'll make it easily . margo 's got no more conception of time than a halibut .
goodbye , mr. sampson .
it means concentration of ambition , desire , and sacrifice such as no other profession demands ... and i 'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can 't be ordinary , can 't be - just someone . to give so much for almost always so little ...
no thanks , birdie .
i know . she just keeps hearin ' her dead father play the banjo .
they can always grab oranges off trees . this you can 't do in times square ...
i never played fort sumter .
oh , brother .
imagine . all this admiration in just one room .
see you home ...
just because you can 't even work a zipper . it was very thoughtful , eve , and i appreciate it-
i don 't care if i never get home .
not at all . margo , this is eve harrington .
it couldn 't possibly interest you .
i think i 'd better . it 's been - well , i can hardly find the words to say how it 's been ...
mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all ...
but not all of it - not that lloyd and i are going to be married .
'remembrance ' .
i hope so , mr. richards . good night ...
i was dreadful , miss channing , believe me - i have no right to be anyone 's understudy , much less yours ...
san francisco . it was the last week . i went one night ... the most important night in my life - until this one . anyway ... i found myself going the next night - and the next and the next . every performance . then , when the show went east - i went east .
thank you , eve . i 'd like a martini - very dry .
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny ! 'aged in wood ' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you 'd seen the play ...
silly , isn 't it ? you 'd think they 'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm ...
it 's about time we did ! it 's about time margo realized that what 's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off .
i have no possible interest in anything she 'd have to say .
did miss harrington tell you to call mr. richards ?
i doubt very much that you 'd like her in 'the hairy ape ' .
and you pose as a playwright . a situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep ...
... among so many quiet qualities .
what is he talking about ?
i ain 't gon na die . not with a hit .
poor max . heartburn ? it 's that miss caswell . i don 't know why she doesn 't give addison heartburn .
mainly it has to do with your choice of words .
it 's safe , try it , you 'll see .
you voted for him .
nothing -- i just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am . i never like it when the other guy 's human ...
-- colson .
we 're inside the white house now .
whatever .
he is not in the car . sorry .
you 're the fella who forgot he rented a hertz car , do i have to tell you they didn 't forget to send us the bill ?
-- yes --

only when they make interesting reading .
i found some in my purse ; would you like one ?
it won 't last .
a detective . he falls for the wrong woman .
i have nothing to hide .
no . i said i liked johnny to use his hands . i don 't give any rules , nick . i go with the flow .
yes it does , doesn 't it ?
i 've got a degree in psych . it goes with the turf . games are fun .
i loved him . i hurt .
you still get the pleasure . didn 't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married , nick ?
no , thanks .
i 'd like to ask you some , too .
what do you want from me , catherine ?
she 's seen everything before .
i told her it was the fuck of the century .
do you want her to join us sometime ?
do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets ? i don 't do those .
i told you i had a vivid imagination .
i don 't have a choice .
i know .
make love to me .
i never have before .
honey , why don 't you go in the car ? i 'll be right there .
of course i knew .
we fuck like minks . we raise rugrats . we live happily ever after .
what are you going to do ? charge me with smoking ?
i had sex with him for about a year and a half . i liked having sex with him .
i 'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book . i 'd be announcing myself as the killer . i 'm not stupid .
why would i need an attorney ?
it 's my first drink in three months . that okay with you , pop ? she doesn 't know me . i never saw her before gus and i talked to her .
hell yes ! couldn 't get it outta my head for years . still can 't . nice little kids -- nice husband , wasn 't porkin ' around -- no financial problems . one day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em . all of 'em . used a knife . he got for a wedding present . didn 't even deny it . sweet as honey . said she didn 't know why she done it .
nothin ' i 'll be okay , pop .
well , hell , son , it 's got a certain ring to it , i 'll say that .
maybe it wasn 't her that paid him . maybe the money was for somethin ' else . how the fuck do i know ? i 'm just an old city cowboy tryin ' not to fall outta his saddle .
she 's right . you got an icepick in you yet ?
ain 't that hard , son . this young farmgirl , she got tired of all that attention goin ' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em . just like 'ole hazel dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young roxy here , she didn 't use a wedding present . she used daddy 's razor .
which one you talkin ' about now , son ? we know ole hazel did it ; we know young roxy did it -- and the other one well , hell , she 's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain .
maybe she did , gus . maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face . let 's polygraph her again and ask her about it .
go stick your head in a tub of ice water . see where she leads .
you 're looking for catherine , not me .
we bring her in for questioning .
maybe that 's what you 're counting on to get you off the hook .
are you vice ?
you wouldn 't be here otherwise , would you ?
fourteen . we seal juvenile records until they 're deceased . that 's why you didn 't find it in your computer .
he was shot .
let 's go to the carnegie museum . they have the world 's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas . it 's really great . it 's in pittsburg .
i really think you should talk to him about this .
hi dad . hi nora .
i don 't know . i told you , this isn 't my apartment .
i hate this . turn that off .
chateau latour '64 , please .
see that table over there ? i 'd like to pay their bill .
use your fucking instinct .
come on in !
yeah ... i 'll paint on it .
i 'm clean . smell me . i always smell good . i don 't know why , i just do !
i do . i just said that . i was never here before . i actually like it .
a friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery . he 's an electrician . i was supposed to be there an hour ago .
you don 't have any fucking money..
you want some ?
well thanks !
george ?
i 'd like to squeeze your titties .
haitian . i 'm going to kill myself . i 'm taking pills . reds , blues , greens .
fame . my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it .
that 's impossible . i 've got , like , five of 'em !
no , actually i feel worse .
yes , i suppose that we did .
right . sure . and `` peace on earth , good will toward men . ''
i 'm -- sorry , i --
we do .
good time , too . everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after new years ' .
a big bag of fan mail ? filthy lucre ? wait don 't tell me ... is it a broad ?
point is , listen to them . they 've lost faith in old symbols . they 're ready to bond with you , the icon of the future . if it works , don 't fix it ...
no , i am . yes , i 'm boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning . i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant , and mr. wayne 's hoped-for investment ... i 've studied up on all of it ... i even opened the protected files and --
ten years . barbara isn 't really me niece , sir . she 's joanna clark 's daughter .
you came to tuck me in . that 's quite a switch . i am looking for my brother , wilfred . he is first butler to the maharajah of mirajanpore . but mirajanpore is a floating court , it travels across india , so wilfred can be rather difficult to find .
no apology necessary . that 's the first time in thirty years .
there 's a lovely inn just down --
don 't be silly , alfred . after all , she 's family .
thanks .
no , my boy . i 'm afraid none of us can .
yes ?
remember this . and remember it always . i 'm proud of you . and i love you too , son .
right here , sir .
divide and conquer .
i hate being lectured .
freeze , you 're mad . this capsule will slaughter thousands .
i didn 't kill your wife .
he 'll be here .
i 'll borrow it from you . four million - -
i can make it .
you left your back wide open . freeze could have killed you .
anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who joanna clark is ?
you are looking unseasonably hot . let 's go inside and grab your rocks .
you leave batman and robin to me .
kill them . of course . but why stop there ? why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished ?
not good .
at you ? polly want a kiss ?
sorry to disappoint you . but rubber lips are immune to your charms .
you must show me your secrets , blossom , before i show you mine .
hello , jason . i think i 've had a change of heart .
maybe you just haven 't met the right woman ...
did two-face call him bruce ?
no more tricks , edward . release chase and dick . this is between you and me .
gracious even in defeat . how vaguely disappointing . when all this could have been ours together .
somebody 's been sending me love letters . commissioner gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion .
i 'm sorry . who are you ?
excuse me , boys . i 'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
let me ask you something , bruce . what is man 's greatest tool ?
what the hell is going on here ?
never heard of a double-cross ?
here . get a good seat .
you 're a genius .
oh yes , and certainly _we_ will !
... very good , sir .
well -- i think you might consider
i just wanted to distract them . i wasn 't trying to get a picture of you .
exploring . in the woods . many years ago . -- i was a solitary child .
well , bruce , some types are a little more obvious than others .
then there 's one thing in the world you don 't do very well . and i know what it is -- now you 'll have to kill me .
... looks like a convention .
very thoughtful . don 't touch it .
i feel naked without it .
the does it . it 's going to be this weekend .
they 'll be sorry . they 'll be sorry . move out !
it 's a detour . they 're backed up for blocks !
eckhardt ... our problems are your problems .
why , eckhardt . you should be thinking about the future .
no wonder you 're such a chickenshit . now shut up . there ain 't no bat .
do you want this money or don 't you ? now shut up ! shut up --
because i want someone i can trust .
jack ? jack ? do i look like a jack ?
ha ! that 's the best part . i can 't ! !
strong stomach , huh ? i like that in a woman -- maybe we can do business after all .
what ? i improved her a little ...
honey - - i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale . if i had a good enough hint .
too much glamor , huh . what 's in the bag - - monte carlo ? apes in kenya ?
some . i am a rich bitch , remember ? i 'm quoting .
bruce wayne ? date ? he called you up and asked you for a date ? shit . hey , miranda ! c'mere ! now pay close attention to this . miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about bruce wayne .
his face . allie , look at his face .

it 's okay . there 's no one out here . just open the door . trust me .

no , i 'm fine .
i 'm afraid you don 't know the half of it . sit down . i have a tale to tell . and not a happy one .
uh ... yes ...
great . classic timing . why don 't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce ? i 'll check my diary later .
yes . ahm ... think i'11 ...
not necessarily . that 's where this ... comes in . no , i 've had a better idea than sacking people . you 'll hear soon enough .

yes , maxine , yes .
it 's okay , my sweet .
he 's a selfish bastard .
perhaps you 'll want to consult that ouija board again .
yonder . twin chestnuts in the yard .
you best leave that quilt alone . that was grandma 's quilt .
do you forgive me ?
it 's the lebaron .
no , man , nothing is fucked here --
well , okay , you 're not privy to all the new shit , so uh , you know , but that 's what you pay me for . speaking of which , would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash ? i got ta check this with my accountant of course , but my concern is that , you know , it could bump me into a higher tax --
sir , this is a mortuary , not a rental house .
yeah , but we 're --
my rug .
yeah , this is the guy , this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug . i mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug .
rug-peers did not do this . i mean look at it . young trophy wife . marries a guy for money but figures he isn 't giving her enough . she owes money all over town --
yeah dude , why is walter so pissed off ?
huh ?
you 're out of your element ! this chinaman is not the issue , dude .
shut the fuck up , donny .
went alright . dude 's car got a little dinged up --
where 's your car , dude ?
oh for christ -- will you shut the fuck up , donny .
you got ta buck up , man , you can 't go into the tournament with this negative attitude --
shut the fuck up , donny . this kid is in the ninth grade , dude , and his father is -- are you ready for this ? -- arthur digby sellers .
shut the fuck up , donny . not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin ' to find reverse on a soviet tank . this is not a worthy --
they won 't hurt us , donny . these men are cowards .
on you , maybe .
i fuckeen kill jor fuckeen car !

well , uh . . . not much to tell .
there 's no fucking reason -- here 's my point , dude -- there 's no fucking reason --
mark it zero !
walter , please --
saturday is shabbas . jewish day of rest . means i don 't work , i don 't drive a car , i don 't fucking ride in a car , i don 't handle money , i don 't turn on the oven , and i sure as shit don 't fucking roll !
for christ 's sake , dude .
hardly dude , a new 'vette ? the kid 's still got , oh , 96 to 97 thousand , depending on the options . wait in the car , donny .
you thought bunny 'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear . all you needed was a sap to pin it on , and you 'd just met me . you thought , hey , a deadbeat , a loser , someone the square community won 't give a shit about .
hey , cool it walter .
dude ! dude , i 'm sorry !
dude , i 'm -- it was an accident !
you 're a fuck , walter !

i understand sir . could you slide your shorts down please ?
bunny .
well , okay , if you 've already made out the check . brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside .
where 's the money , lebowski ?
walter !
this is a league game , smokey !
i came all the way down here same as you did . keep from gettin ' killed . happened to see those jarheads beatin ' on a good collar -- habla ingles , tomas ?
you 're missing the point . their vampire victims don 't die . they turn . they become carriers . if the reapers continue unchecked , there could be thousands of them before the month is over . do the math .
we need it . sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest . tattoos , piercings , tribal scarring -- because we regenerate , none of it 's permanent . so we have to take it to the next level . to remind us we 're alive .
minutes .
fry 'em .
i want to see the sun rise .
ran into a little reaper trouble myself .
why don 't you ask your girlfriend ?
blood ...
not alone .
i should think that would be obvious at this point .
ultra-rapid detox . they use it on heroin addicts , make 'em go cold-turkey in one night .
i don 't know about this , man --
human ?
keep your friends close and your enemies closer . isn 't that how the saying goes ?
you 're wasting your time , blade . the flechette 's a dud .
two things . one , i was on to you the moment they turned you . and two -- i switched that dud of yours back with the real one .
ain 't no thing but a chicken wing , buttercup .
yeah , but you fangs can see in the dark . what am i supposed to do ?
look , what 's your problem ?
look , kid , they obviously found your base of operations . if it was a trap , why flip their dicks by announcing themselves ?
after last night ? dude , i 'm a lover , not a fighter .
it 's because i 'm human that i can do this .
it 's war , now get the fuck out of the way !
owned by vampires . there 's one of these in every major city , and just like domino 's , they always deliver . you telling me you 're ready to walk through that door ?
serum -- it 's a human hemoglobin substitute .
for your miracle cure ?
we 've got a good arrangement , that 's all . whistler makes the weapons , i use them , the vampires die -- end of story .
your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card .
you make it sound like i 'm already dead .
what are you talking about ?
yes you will . the human side of you is stronger . i know it is .
just the blood sample from the pericardial sac .
sometimes --
the other elders will never let you get away with this !
some of the old wives ' tales are true -- they 're severely allergic to silver , various types of wood . feed them garlic and they 'll go into anaphylactic shock --
we weren 't sure we could trust you .
frost 's bodycount keeps rising , and i 'm not getting any younger , am i ?
-- which she may have --
join the club .
i 'm not a witch , you 're all crazy !
-- my god , nick ? ? ?
sometimes . where are we going ?
buried deep under 200 years worth of soil , ash , and compost layers .
-- nick ! !
we 've looked at half of one tape .
-- cotter 's --
-- what 're you saying ? ? i didn 't have anything to do with --
both . now .
sometimes .
-- yeah , the goddamn stoners ! who you think stole the stuff ! ?
hey , mr. graduate fucking thesis here was s'posed to be driving !
oh , for chrissake , she was an actor .
what 're you , nuts ?
-- coming out of the water --
still don 't see it --
-- before you lose your emotional lunch .
i am .
fine .
all i need --
-- great : we can watch domini sleep for hours -- or , shit , maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days , maybe a deer 'll dash by !
-- still go see the ob in the morning --
guy who killed all the kids in the '40s .
ancient runes --
rusty parr had the right idea on child care .
-- and we brought it back with us !
okay .
that they 'll start touching us inside our heads .
we 're not dealing with fucking logic here !
i am ?
i ... i 'm sorry , meurice . i got ta talk to you ... can i come in ?

i just know , that 's all . i remember you from central .
thanks for the tour . it was nice talking to you .
yeah . good bye .
i don 't want you to get involved , really , i mean , i do , but if something went wrong i mean , like you said , they may be involved in murder .
i 'll drink to that .
frank ! !
it 's good to see you , dad .
this is it .
of course , jeffrey .
later mike . i got ta take care of someone who 's hurt here , in case you haven 't noticed .

try the back bedroom .
que es lo que quieren de me , hijueputas campesinos ?
oh , shut up , fred . shut your big fat mouth . you don 't buy it all at once . it 's called layaway .
i 'm going to california .
i 'm going to california .
that was a good one , dad . that was really something . remember that ?
he 's going down , george . it 's election year . we 're not making any deals .
holy shit , dulli . what the hell are you doing here ?
the set-up is wrong . we 're doing all the legwork , and at the end of the day , we 're still paying retail . we 're getting middled .
don 't give me that shit . you just better do something .
yeah . i 'm fine . i 'm good .
better than you .
what 's happening to us ?
i 'll be here .
yes , i am .
actually , i 've got some news . that fifty thousand i promised you , i couldn 't get it .
who speaks spanish ?
don 't be such a pussy .
no , it 's better if he doesn 't . the house is filled with new people .
it 's a question of habit ...
no , they 'll do even more . we 've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... do you understand what i mean ? starting tomorrow , they won 't be groping in the dark any more ; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy , a self-confessed criminal ... and they will be able to pass to the offensive . have you thought of this ?
good evening , sir .
fine , charlie . you familiar with the marsh case ?
right now . guess who 's been buying coke from him for the last five and half years ?
thanks , mister d .
how ?
yes .
can we put rebecca lawson at the scene ?
we had dinner at a restaurant .
no further questions .
you 're lying . marsh was wearing a cast on the tape . it was right before he went to chicago and met miss lawson . he dumped you for her , didn 't he ?
what do you think i 've got ? a gun ? maybe i 'm gon na kill you too . maybe i 'll blow your head off right now .
because he called me .
there are no charges against you . i 'm here to decide if i 'm going to represent you should that occur . did you kill him ?
sure . where to ?
you take a lot for granted .
i went out on the boat .
are you scared ?
that 's crazy .
she 's waiting in the conference room .
`` discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities . '' who told you to say that ?
mr. cardenas , i suggest you move on to another line of questioning .
mr. roston ?
some example you set .
yeah -- but can she cook ?
where have you been ?
is this what you want -- huh ? is it ?
sorry .
daddy -- stop it !
well , no one in my family did ! dad bought cemetery plots at oak ridge . one for him , one for mom .
why are there two deeds here ?
no . you can have them .
he 's not coming .
well , i don 't care if it 's legal or not , we 're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can 't even go visit her because she 's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray .
sshhh . `` after going through the safety deposit box , i 'm sure you 'll find you 're way to this letter . it 's hard to write this to my own children . i could let this die with the rest of me , i suppose . but as one gets older , one fears subside . what becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay . row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were . it 's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it 's something that just happens . i don 't know if it 's as simple for children . you 're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong . but i thought it was important to give you that chance . to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was ...

i 've lost you . you 're gone . i can 't hear anything .
i 'm making my turn . i see the school up ahead .
that 's not her .

well , it was about five days ago . you were outside the pig 'n whistle and you had one hell of an argument .
how did she ... ... happen to have them ?
i don 't think so , mrs. mulwray . of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information , we 'll be in touch .
yes . as i said , i was very grateful .
i was grateful .
oh .
she 's my sister and my daughter !
okay .
don 't be sorry , neither does dad . wanted to make sure though , didn 't we , honey ?
nothin ' , morty , it 's my lunch hour , i thought i 'd drop by and see who died lately .
they 're all a bunch of phonies .
i don 't want mulvihill . i want the big boys that are making the payoffs .
of course i knew your father . he was tall , thin , pleasant , and had a moustache like mine . always smiling . he looked like clark gable .
it tastes wonderful !
come in , alfredo .
progress ! it always arrives too late !
what 's she like ? what 's she like ? ...
whatever you do , love it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little ...
yeah ! ... getting there 's downhill and all the saints help you . but coming back ! the saints stand there watching you , that 's all ! god 's will be done .
father adelfio , i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul . and you 've got to help me , because i 've lost all peace of mind ...
i know . but take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes , for example ! i think about it a lot ... how is it possible for ...
elena . my name 's elena .
nor have i . even though you disappeared ... but what 's the point of talking about it ? we risk being pathetic and ridiculous . you still live in rome ?
it takes years to get there . and years to come back ... now go to bed , toto , it 's late .
it 's not true ! no ! it 's not true ! ! ! i 'll show you he 's coming back !
six years ago this may . no one came any more . you `` know better than me , mr. di vita , the crisis , television , videos . by now the movie business is only a dream . the city 's bought it now to make a new parking lot . next saturday they 're tearing it down ... a pity ! ...
i rather like it myself . send it right away .
where is he ?
oh !
sit down , everybody - for heaven 's sake !
it 's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
yes .
we 've got a nice plant here .
charles ! your - your breaking this man 's neck - would scarcely explain this note - serious consequences for mr. kane - for myself , and for my son . what does this note mean , miss -
chicago is pretty close to new york nowadays - only twenty hours -
charles .
i 've tried to tell you , emily . the president 's going to be all right . he had a comfortable night . there 's no danger of any kind .
charlie , he said , unless you withdrew your name -
i know exactly what i 'm doing . get out !
if these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
you can 't stop me .
i think we 'll have to send our friend wheeler a cable , mr. bernstein . of course , we 'll have to make it shorter than his , because he 's working on an expense account and we 're not . let me see - mike !
all right .
people are going to know who 's responsible . and they 're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly . and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news .
it 's a good idea for a newspaper . four hundred sixy thousand .
what do you mean by that ?
if i want to , i can go to court . a father has a right to -
it is . go on , mr. thatcher -
the bank 's decision in all matters concerning his education , his place of residence and similar subjects will be final .
we will assume full management of the colorado lode - of which you , mrs. kane , are the sole owner .
right here , mrs. kane .
i wonder - you put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell ?
good !
we 're leaving tonight . as soon as they 're through photographing the stuff -
i 'll have a highball .
i 'm not from a newspaper exactly , i -
this ? how long have you been smoking ?
you two better quit it .
i didn 't just fuck myself ! jesus , i 'm going to be sick !
call the police .
oh god ...
no . i place the time of death at about three-twenty .
i can 't say for certain until we get him back to the lab , but my guess is he was masturbating , his heart seized and he died . that 's when the girl found him . something smells like shoe polish .
fuck that ! i 'm gon na break my crazy neck on this ladder !
i 'll assess all i want !
give me a stick , pretty boy ! i 'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass .
to the back , above the oil . how long are you staying ?
lenin 's tomb .
annoying customer .
peptic ulcer .
hey man , i hear caitlin 's marrying an asian drum major .
i thought redding had like three balls !
i told him that and he yelled at me .
at least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here .
it 's going to have to do for now , considering that it 's my car that 's up for request . can i help you ?
could be .
shut the fuck up !
would you shut the fuck up ? who the fuck is in the bathroom ?
i was born .
i know i can bench more than that !
i don 't have love handles .
hey man , that was a long time ago . don 't let it get to you .
forget it . i don 't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old . can i offer you a ride somewhere ?
'bout the biggest pair you ever seen ! nynne ! !
unlike you , i have a class in forty- five minutes .
i 've been here since six o'clock this morning . why ?
the due date is on the bottom . this summons can not be contested in any court of law . failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence , and a warrant will be issued for your arrest . have a nice day .
wait , there 's more . olaf : sing ...
he 's got his own band in moscow . it 's called `` fuck your yankee blue jeans '' or something like that .
oh , i know . if i had to work here all day , i 'd be bloated and out of shape , too .
yeah !
that 's sick , dante .

forget it . if that charge goes off before we can reach it , this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us . this way .
jess , c'mon ...
the only faster way up is the east face and it 's smooth as glass . maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather , only a psycho would try it in a storm .
how far ?
we 're not animals , but don 't force us to be . walk over .
sue me .
there is .
when he finds the money , you 're as dead as me .
somehow i didn 't think you 'd wait for me if i 'd sent it first .
there , what 's that place ?
i haven 't even got on it yet . let 's go , time to fetch .
we can 't and he knows it .
we 're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here . where 's the next one ?
you dumb bastard , you waited too long . if he made it back , this place would have been covered with police in a few hours . the way we 're moving , it 's going to be anyway .
insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us .
welly , welly , welly , welly , welly , welly , well . to what do i owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit ? georgie rises .

have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness ?
have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness ?
are you now , or ever have been , a homosexual ?
it says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the ludovico treatment . alex signs . governor gathers up papers . alex dots the last `` i '' and smiles .
dad ... it 's the treatment . more retching .
would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea , son ?
are you feeling better ?
no , no , no . that 's enough . he 's perfect . i want his records sent to me . this vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition .

your father , he was dying . he was worried about you . he took your picture out to look at it . he called you his baby .
without a love of my own .
i can 't promise you anything .
i don 't understand .
i want this box rigged with a beacon !
what do i look like to you ? switzerland ?

it can 't be coming from vega , the system 's too young .
it 's a civilian facility .
it 's incredibly rich . we 've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages ' ; right now we 're on 10,413 .
you don 't seem to understand that it 's your interests i 'm trying to protect -- !
the librarian ... or the library ... ?
once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer . please , sit , doctor . i have guests so rarely , it 's important to me they feel welcome in my home . did you know this was once yeltsin 's flying dascha ? that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot . at least that 's what the people who sold me the plane said ...
can 't . doctor 's orders . the low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive . it 's all right -- i like it here . ever try sex in zero-g ?
you too .
i remember . you were indelicate , indiscreet and entirely less than tactful ... sound like anyone you know ?
it wasn 't his fault . nobody said anything about seats . we --

i thought you knew , boy ... they sentenced me by the mile .
long enough to see redhots come and redhots go .
stop beatin ' , man . you ain 't doin ' nobody no good .
that 's what you 're gon na have to do .
the man wants speed , let 's give it to him . ram it in and break it off . go hard . shag it .
they ain 't never seen a bull gang before .
knock it off , luke ! you cain 't talk about him that way .
oh , that 's mah darlin ' luke . grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator .
you jus ' may be great at hangin ' paper around the big cities , but us country boys is not entirely brainless . when it comes to the law , nothin ' is understood .

a phoney ? whatta you mean , a phoney ?
you can 't expect him to learn everything the first day . hopefully it 's taught him a very valuable lesson .
this is a big day for the guards . they get to remind us who 's boss .
well ! aren 't we the daring one ? what 's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make doctor helen set foot outside her door ? the antenna is gone off her car again . i had no music , all the way to the market . let me find a garage for it ?
about what ?
hey , no . leave those here . if you really want her help . i mean if you really do , leave them . let her see them . i 'll see they 're safe ...
it 's too big a file to copy to a disk .
so far nothing they test for comes up positive .
what 's that music . it 's abba . i can hear it . it 's abba .
you called us , doctor , if you don 't want to look at them here , how about downtown . i 'll drive you down ...
not yet .
shhh . it 's okay . just breathe . i 'll fix it ...
oh , i know .
yeah , but she had divine guidance .
look at him , grandstanding ...
helen ... excuse me , we ...
no , she can come in tomorrow ... gon na want to know a lot of things ...
yes . from wendel . to celebrate , the license approval for our air-charter firm . i forgot to tell you .
well , yes . you 're getting out of bed tomorrow . they want you to walk .
my last lesson 's next week . james ... my car ...
james .
haven 't i ? to the airport , if you could .
i don 't know . you can never be sure with vaughan . this is his show .
it 's not the police . it 's the department of transport . internal politics . it 's a joke . they have no idea who we really are
i live in my car . this is my workshop .
i think in the spirit of group therapy , it 's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others .
i miss beast a lot , too .
there 's nothing to tell .
well , my theory is that people can really enjoy math , but they lose interest ...
mom won 't miss your wedding . she 'll come around . i promise she will .
she said she 'd be here at 10 .
i 'd have to see it on .
but everything 's ok ?
do you think i should ?
i 'll be back before you can say souffle .
oh , no , of course not .
i didn 't say ...
that 's thanks to all your help .
wow . congratulations .
no , not yet . but you know paul . he 's sure to get it .
can i get you a glass of champagne ?
we all agree with the doctor , dear . he thinks it 's safer for you to stay here for a while .
just think , pretty soon , we 'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you . of course , if that 's what you still want . ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here .
when did you start smoking ?
and if i want to smoke , i 'll fucking smoke .
just eat whatever you want . this will give you a chance to meet some people .
it 's ok . it 's good to let it out .
i guess so . i think that 's right .
i 'm glad .
it 's ok . it 's not a pass-fail kind of thing .
anything interesting .
i 've already checked it out 17 times .
it 's magic .
ok , ok , i 'll give it back .
exactly .
back-to-back sessions with the shrink .
what are the delusions like ?
aren 't you ever quiet ?
open up . i want to see .
out ? are you kidding ? i 've got all the fixings here .
no .
i 'll see you tonight .
thanks .
you don 't have to take care of me , you know .
coming .
i got worried . are you ok ?
it wasn 't exactly a lie .
michael , calm down . please . it 's ok .
that 's the best idea i 've heard in a long time .
how about something better ? like a kiss .
you should go .
the receptionist said you called earlier about something .
good going . i knew you could do it .
i mean tonight .
i 'm calling in sick .
so , what do you say , let ?
i need to tell you something , and i 'm not sure how .
i do apologize . a student had a crisis .
you 'll never get out of the city .
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can 't say anything .
what ? this ?
no , i 'm good , angelo .
you have enough to worry about , angelo . you don 't need my problems .
how about if i call you ?
she probably hid it at her place . the six of us could find it in --
too risky . we don 't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car .
i 'm just setting my boundaries .
where are you from ?
we are tired and bored with your bullshit . so , put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass .
cops ?
and be careful when you get near the top . zero has a very long one .
we 'll think of something .
mr. bastaldi isn 't asking you if you want to go . he 's telling you you 're going ! and if he 's telling you you 're going to be going then you are going to go !
i think he 's already figured that out .
you know , if you could get your nose out of bastaldi 's ass for two seconds you might see what 's going on around you .
better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night .
maybe if we gave the tapes back --
good . zero and julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector . the rest of us will come in through the front door .
all you are is a professional ass-kisser .
no ?
he 's been shot a lot . he 's used to it .
i promised bonanno i 'd destroy the tapes .
there 's just one more thing i need you to do .
hard to say .
send some flowers . something nice . roses or carnations . and one of those get well soon cards .
oh , i 'm sorry .
oh , then we will have the house wine .
c'mon , get real , will you . you think he 's just going to forget about this ? these guys are all about respect . all about honor . he 's coming after us , so we might as well take the money .
relax . it will be fine .
stop talking . i 'm trying to concentrate .

yeah and he can 't stand it that i tried to do something to better myself .
i know where she went .
feel free to correct him if you want .
watch this .
oh , you think ?
wait here .
how are we supposed to sleep with this noise ?
i don 't know .
take a nap .
the lucky ones .
that 's why we 're only breaking one arm .
long .
he is my defeated foe !
don 't invite danger into your father 's house .
maybe it is . i wouldn 't know .
yes , from the west . he went undercover and and followed her here ,
she 's out there , but i doubt she 'll show herself . we 'll keep our eyes open . sooner or later , she 'll come for the girl .
all right . i 'll write you an introduction . take it to wudan . wait there for news from me .
i doubt it . this thief ... it very unusual ...
father !
who ever made that .
i call it blood , detective . if you want , you can call it graffiti .
this is special , darlin ' . please ?
double homicide . a year ago . las halloween .
no further . i 'm serious .
you must listen carefully : the fire department will be here soon . there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance . as shelly webster once needed your assistance , and as you are shortly going to need my assistance .
the venom of bad memories . you were there ; you saw her . i saw you seeing her .
my pleasure . eric don 't smoke these .
it can 't rain all the time .
i dabble . may i ?
i don 't know you ...
victims . aren 't we all .
i took yours from you . your little girlfriend ? i took hers , too . your meaningless , petty life ? i took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose . you 're no avenger . you 're mine .
magic .
tell me i 'll get hurt . that i might die . i 've already done that . i don 't need anyone 's help . yours included .
no . i saw a guitar . this isn 't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay , is it ? there was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird . in blood .
this is a cobra , mr. grange . yes , it is real .
i was just being honest . you happen to have a nice ass . sorry .
fine . friends it is . i can live with that .
it 's not about being happy . you and i can 't -
i will .
yeah , me neither .
i 'm just being honest . i just wanted to see what you were like in bed .
relax . it 's okay . take a deep breath .
thanks . nice meeting you .
how are things down under ? blossoming i hope .
for the first time , yes . it 'll pass .
jesus !
get out of here .
but i can 't even see her . she doesn 't have her own phone , i don 't even know her e-mail address .
no .
outstanding .
shut up and turn to page 64 .
could you be more desperate to read it ?
then do me a favor and get rid of her . if not for me , then do it for you . look at yourself . you 're a joke . she 's turned you into jelly . what do you want to be , one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling . people used to respect you . they feared you and now you 're going to throw that all away .
well done .
not my choice of toast , but it 's your call . to your triumph over annette .
i 'm sorry , but unfortunately i don 't fuck losers .
whatever . you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again . is that understood ? !
you must be sebastian . i 've heard such nice things about you .
oh ... no thank you ...
no . i only let her go with edward . it 's alright .
i can make wishes like this come true . i 'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself tell the truth --
i had my breakfast while you were still asleep .
you can 't open it yet . you have to put all of them under the tree until morning .
she 's not irena 's child -- there 's nothing of irena in her . she 's my child .
i forgot i had it on .
well , you know where it is .
you 'll see it when it 's all lit and ready for you .
you 're upset about me -- i made you fight -- i hate for you to fight .
because she is my friend .
whenever you want .
oh , i suppose it was to the wind you sang , or maybe to the sun , or the clouds , or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden .
but mrs. farren just started to tell me a story . please .
it 's a hard winter . all the animals are bold as brass , coming down into the streets for food . you 'll see a lot of deer this winter .
but i saw what it was . it 's the little deer .
good .
a christmas present . it 's been so long since i 've had a christmas present .
my daughter died long ago .
anybody could know that song .
yes , barbara ... barbara ...
good night ... barbara ...
that 's from her -- that woman .
wait a minute . listen .
perhaps she 's wanted for understanding .
can we get some service here ?
i 've changed a lot lately .
at victoria 's secret .
no , it was another woman .
good . except for pms .
people notice you frida .
or if your boyfriend 's an asshole .
oh , my glasses ! maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them .
my vision got worse again .
no they 're not .
you should have seen it erect .
hide him .
hey , how about a little nightcap ?
since when do you care ?
i 'm kinda borrowing it . who 's this , mr. date-guy ?
we ... he walked me home and ... we said goodnight . um , he kissed me goodnight and that was it .
at least let me give you this back . i washed it .
no . nope , nothing in it .
no ! i ... i checked when i put my stuff in . i always look through the washer first .
it wasn 't a date . jennifer invited me along to dinner with them .
still haven 't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off . never seen anything like it .
no . but i don 't mind hairy . are you okay ?
yes or no ? frida , can 't you just be honest with me ?
okay .
oh , i see ... interesting theory .
let 's explore this . what makes you feel you 're a werewolf ?
oh my god , what happened ?
no , i said it was our first date .
no , take it .
tell her i 'm eating .
yeah , sorry . uh ... gregory 's roommate told us you were out with him last night .
we 're just trying to figure out what happened .
he 's been running money for the mafia .
torn apart . limb from limb . a bloody gruesome mess .
and he was missing an arm .
this one walk you home too ?
yes , of course . everything 's fine ...
i think it 's time you introduced us to your little friends .
i 'm afraid so .
a hunch . he might be able to ...
i see ...
it sure isn 't the fun-fair .
no ... no doctor ...
a few days ... a few weeks - dunno , i can 't remember . worse thing is , i never know if it will change back again ... now , please leave me alone .
no . have a look .
just let me sit here for a moment ? ill go soon , and stop bothering you .
i told you , i can 't remember a thing !
not exactly . she was found in a canal , disembowelled . throat cut . blood drained . the body wrapped in a bed-sheet .
maybe .
i don 't blame you for getting angry . you are in a frustrating situation . you must be patient though . trust me completely . i 'm here to help .
that 's easy . you ...
uh -- i don 't know . sometimes it 's just like a barter thing ... is this legal ?
don 't worry .
it 's simple , alan . we send the vice- president to africa or something , dig up some dirt on him , force him to resign and get our `president ' to nominate a new one . the whole thing takes a few weeks tops .
are you out of your mind ?
dave , these things get awfully complicated sometimes ...
i don 't think so .
oh yeah ... 1 'm fine ...
right . we can pick up on the rest tomorrow .
absolutely . well , that might be kind of tough . once the press starts smelling blood ...
he 's not .
certainly .
but it 's ten-thirty at night .
i had a feeling .
yeah , but bob found me when i was stuck in firearms and tobacco ...
no thanks . it 's not that far .
thanks , duane .
go tuck yourself , bill .
there 's no mistake , bill . if you veto their funding , it 's not a mistake . if you hurt someone intentionally , it 's not a mistake .
i don 't know . i hadn 't thought it out that far .
oh ... okay .
just wait .
what ?
yeah , well ... it 's finally over .
maybe . we 'll have a little talk first . then ... .maybe ... i can help you out . string him up .
leave him .
no . i didn 't stop the infection in time . i know . don 't worry . when he dies , i won 't be like maria . i 'll shoot him .
let 's just ... .wait a minute . get a better look .
come on .
i have looked bad for four years . everyone in the world has looked bad for four years . thank god looks don 't matter as much as they once did .
hmmmmmm ? oh , yes . go on .
i know you can . like i said , we been watchin ' you .
you disappear in here , darlin ' . you get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins . you get lost out here and nobody 's gon na notice . rhodes , he counts on that . it all makes for food in the freezers .
we 're only about a quarter-mile from cave entrance number five .
forever , darlin ' . forever . 'til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind .
he 's my contact for chrissake ! there 's two crates . can you get me into the hospital ?
come on . let 's go .
they will never be satisfied with anything else , miss henried . they want human flesh . i 'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don 't get mine ! not while i 'm still using it !
and you 're the one who builds the bomb and they says , 'i hope it 'll never actually be used ' .
will do .
knox ?
yeah ! tell him off ! it couldn 't get any worse .
yep .
i 'll tell you later .
how about a trig study group ? right after dinner .
except sex .
garden ?
i couldn 't stop myself .
so much the better .
so avoid using the word 'very ' because it 's lazy . a man is not very tired , he is exhausted . don 't use very sad , use morose . language was invented for one reason , boys -- to woo women -- and , in that endeavor , laziness will not do . it also won 't do in your essays .
i 'm sorry . i , we
miss it ? it drives us crazy . that 's part of what this club is about . in fact , i 'd like to announce that i 've published an article in the school paper , in the name of the dead poets society , demanding girls be admitted to welton , so we can all stop beating off .
and are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say ? if all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other , what the hell are we doing ?
good . we 're very excited about him . he was a rhodes scholar , you know .
that 's not my fault .
oh yeah . sure . valedictorian , national merit scholar
my parents made me take clarinet but i hated it . the sax is more sonorous .
i 'm one of the proofers . i slipped the article in .
damn it , neil , the name is nuwanda .
it 's not all right . come on , dad
nice meeting you , knox . bye , gin .
ridgeway high . how 's henley hall , gin ?
huh ?
all i 'm asking you to do is listen . `` the heavens made a girl named chris , with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold . ''
it 's just for a little while . you promised .
precisely , meeks . greek for the herd . however , be warned that , when you say `` the hoi polloi '' you are actually saying the the herd . indicating that you too are `` hoi polloi . ''
i have something .
all poetry was acceptable . the name simply referred to the fact , that to join the organization , you had to be dead .
you have another choice .
i don 't know .
yeah , you just do everything they say ! you 'll be in daddy 's law firm as sure as i 'm standing here . and you 'll be approving loans till you croak .
what i have to do . screw the annual .
listen , anything 's , better than mystery meat .
she 's practically engaged to chet danburry . mr. mondo jocko himself .
nothing . no mention of it .
then you can help him .
good luck .
good boy . call us if you need anything .
forget it , pitts , you 're coming . meeks , your grades hurting too ?
todd anderson .
thanks but i 'd better do history .
i guess .
maybe they don 't think at all unless it 's about my brother ! his birthday 's always a big to-do . the stupid thing is , i didn 't even like the first one .
we 're going to die here ! we 're going to die !
all right , be cool , everybody , nice and slow , no sudden moves .
i 'll kill you ! ! i 'll fucking kill you ! ! i 'll do it ! i 'll do it ! i 'm not playin ' around here !
i don 't know what these things are ... all i know is ...
and where is our point of arrival ?
and she could do a hell of a barbie to boot ! belt up . you 'll find all the parts you need up there .
i 'd say that 's a pretty good assumption .
i told you ...
... there 's got to be a way to access out back there ...
on the side ! !
you quit high school , lie about your age , join the navy , and next thing you know , four years are up and you need a way to make a living ...
soon as i get over the heart attack ...
i 'm flying blind here god damn it !
i know ... i know ... if the cash is there we don 't care ... finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried ...
good ! so maybe he also know where the hell am i going to get the parts i need ...
i 'm stuck ...
that way .
just the man i wanted to see . on this puppy here , you remember if it 's red to blue or blue to red ...
seafood salad . you ever operate a jet ski ?

i 'm going to kill you when this is all over .
i 've been alone for twenty years . i don 't feel very sociable .
i 'll be alright .
you stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me . i was iced . what better way to keep me from talking . stop me if i 'm wrong .
i was part of the escort team that re-animated him . my partner 's dead because of this guy .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you want evidence . i 'll give you evidence .
kill me if you want . hard line me with that 'i ain 't got nothing to lose ' bullshit . but you 've got plenty to lose 'partner ' . you 've got a family . i 'm giving you a chance to see them . i kept in touch . she never married . all these years . maybe she loves you . i wouldn 't know why .
keep 'em busy .
commissioner gallagher said ... ... twenty years is a long time .
doucet killed my partner .
i 'm not fond of television comedies .

i don 't know what 's going on , but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again , you 're not gon na get any help from us . it 's ending at your doorstep .
oh my god , the others !

i 'm not agreeing . don 't think i 'm agreeing , because i 'm not .
i can 't move . i can 't get out .

yes . later .
sorry . i took a benzedrine .
don 't move ! stand absolutely still ! hana stops .
i 'm afraid so , sir . kip hurries to his tent . hana follows him .
it doesn 't matter . really . i think i can muddle through . okay - the story of candaules and gyges . king candaules was passionately in love with his wife - one day he said to gyges , the son of somebody , anyway - his favorite warrior -
why not ?
no . i think i was a pilot . i was found near the wreckage of a plane by the bedouin . i was with them for some time .
there are times when you don 't answer the phone .
put the bolts on that window under a scope , i 'm betting you 'll find wrench scratches on them .
how about if you try disappearing .
you 're joking . you can 't trust anyone these days .
oh , i 'm taking you ... quite seriously .
oh , that 's quite all right . no charge .
it 's simple . you pick up the painting , you pay for it with this debit card .
up to you . you could tell him the check is in the mail .
i 'm not the one to ask ...
i guess i have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do .
my job , my rules . we 've got a job to do . no mixing business and pleasure .
it was perfect .

i sincerely hope not .
no , you can 't .
next time i 'll use valet parking .
this better be worth 1t .
we wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces , you know ? and they don 't come off . but when you find the one person who really knows you , and then you lose her ...
what 's your point ?
well it oughta be , with all the work i put into it .
well , then -- if you 're feeling up to it , maybe we should talk shop .
it 's enough -- for whatever you need , for whatever your girls need , for whatever your girls ' girls need -- it 'll be enough .
bullshit . you 're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed . fuck if i 'll help you do that .
you wan na know , you got ta hire me back . i got a lot of bills to pay .
look , erin , this is not the way i do business , this extortion nonsense .
and i realized , he 's taking a chance too .
yeah , yeah . remind me of that when i 'm filing for bankruptcy .
she lived on the plume . you never know .
well , good , ed . i like working with you too .
they 're trying to intimidate us . tell them to wait in the conference room .
you might want to think real hard about the amount , too . my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now , cause i still don 't make enough to afford good child care . makes me think about looking around for a job where i 'm appreciated , for shit 's sake .
don 't joke . they might . so do me a favor and behave yourself for once . ed masry to see kurt potter .
yesterday .
that 's right .
at the time , i thought , i got six kids , some of 'em want to go to college . i can 't afford to lose my job . i told myself i was being honorable . but there 's nothing honorable in what i did . maybe that 's why they picked me for the job . maybe they knew what kind of man i was .
how come you 're not eating ?
sweetheart , you can get a whole big bunch .
hi , rosalind , this is erin . brockovich . from the file room ? i was wondering if you could tell mr. masry that i 'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office .
so did i .
in the conference --
yeah , i 'm gon na start sleeping here . masry & vititoe , can i -- damn it . does anyone know anything about these phones ?
well , god damn it , matthew -- randy 's mom doesn 't work eighteen-hour days , and randy 's dad didn 't leave her , so figuring out who 's gon na take who where is a little easier over at randy 's house .
i 'm gon na go live with george .
yeah . she is . but you know what ? that 's why i 'm helping her . so she can get some medicine to make her feel better .
cause her own mom 's real sick , too .
yeah , we had them couriered over . and listen , good work . they 're a great start . we 're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research .
that 's all you got , lady . two wrong feet . in fucking ugly shoes .
yeah , we 'll just see about that , won 't we ?
what do you mean ?
just a few more minutes , then we can go . take her , will you ?
i pretty much knew what your answer was gon na be .
i don 't know . few days . thanks for helping me . i appreciate it .
yeah , but i 'm gon na get better . a lot of these folks aren 't .
we 'll just be a minute . get a little more sleep .
i will . bye .
yeah . who are you ?
what ?
i 'm surprised donna didn 't say anything .
we 've come this far ... he is our only hope .
you are the last jedi , luke . you are our only hope . be patient .
everyone 's invited , of course .
barks an argument and shakes his head .
okay , okay .
barks his agreement .
barks his agreement .
away put your weapon . i mean you no harm .
then i 'll see you in hell .
the energy shield is down . we 'll be stuck here forever .
sir , i 'm almost afraid to ask , but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me ?
i must admit there are times i don 't understand human behavior .
i 'm going to see what it is .
not collapsing , honey . it 's closing ! this is no cave ...
good . soon as we 're clear , we 'll kick this baby into hyperdrive .
no kidding . if this snowball 's got nasty natives , they could be anywhere .
ooops ! i guess you haven 't told luke about that yet .
come on , your highness , are you telling me you haven 't been thinking about that kiss ?
wait , don 't open it ... that 's one of the traps for the ice creatures .
don 't worry , your holiness , i 'll get her started .
or you ran into something ... .
would you please stop calling me that ?
that 's quite a compliment .
there will be more of them . they always travel in groups . and there 's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships . just what we need right now .
the entrance is collapsing !
the fleet is finally breaking up . i 'm hoping they 'll follow standard imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed .
let er go , chewie .
luke ! i 'm sure he 's fine . probably sitting around wondering what we 're doing right now .
don 't worry . you haven 't seen the last of us .
i 'm sorry too .
don 't ask me , but he 's on his way .
... we 're the bait .
there 's not much chance , but the bounty hunter 's ship is on the east landing platform .
his fate is sealed . you 'll be lucky to get out yourself . all systems are on alert . everything 's locked .
wait a minute . we 're not going back there .
not yet . they 're working on it now .
what is it ?
we have no choice . send them up ... and start clearing everyone out .
if i might remind you , sir , the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
i thought you knew this person .
let 's go .
what did you say ? !
you will be , my young one . heh . you will be .
size has no meaning . it matters not . look at me . judge me by my size do you ?
yes ... i also feel danger ... death . something 's not right .
time will tell .
we know that .
he 's a gorilla .
plissken , slow down the sub . you 're overloading the power plant .
we have a little arrangement . anything happens to me , you 're dead .
cuervo jones has more firepower than two armies . no one gets near him .
my name is hershe hernandez , do you understand , cowboy ?
not anymore .
we get the girl and the prototype . and we get out .
if i 'm late , carjack , don 't start without me .
somebody get off !
you assholes didn 't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service . what'ya want ?
yeah , i got it .
i give you my word . put the prototype into my hands , and you 're a free man .
i used to represent the guy who invented it . i swear to god , snake . no bullshit .
bluebacks . i 'm not bullshittin ' . i swear to god .
don 't like it , don 't come .
yeah . the place kept changing owners . finally went bankrupt . that thing in paris killed 'em .
i just thought you wanted to get away . i didn 't know you wanted to go someplace .
the what ?
sewers . come on .
who ?
thank god .
... i saw nothing .
i will not .
i , the best knight in the world , bested ! this is a great day , for my search is over . i love you , my king .
we spared the lives of a few , so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of king arthur 's knights ...
but one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the king 's law .
it is deep ...
what 's this , what 's this ? !
... of course ...
i had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so i could get some honey , and i didn 't feel up to using any more magic just yet . anyway , i was in less danger than you 'll be in today .
... to ride out and meet them .
never where you expect it , that 's all i know .
what is it my child ?
and i offer only this , father . to commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit , as man and king .
well hurry then , and get it .
we fought and won battles , and now one man defeats all my knights ? i will go .
no . i meant not to be angry with you , sir gahalt . in the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil . you merely repeat it . please , sir , have one of those apples that lancelot loves , and in that gesture partake of its goodness .
he has given up .
we are to blame .
you 're a man ? ! ... with metal skin !
walls of shining crystals , burning with red fire , furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man ...
talk . lovers murmuring to each other ...
doing what i did for you , it wasn 't easy , you know . it takes it 's toll . it took nine moons to get back my strength .
you didn 't ask !
of course i didn 't .
please .
what 's her name ?
karl ! !
no thanks karl .
what was going on in there , how could she jump off the bed like that ?
oh . what are you talking about for christ sake ! did you see her or not ? she 's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or ...
father ?
that 's good .
okay .
until she rots and lie stinking in the earth .
uoy era ohw .
and the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her .
amen
i think the point is to make us dispair ... to see our selves as ... animal and ugly ... to reject the possibillity that god could love us .
don 't listen .
are you tired ?
be silent !
o'lord hear my prey .
i 'll take her inside . you too , little frank . out of the pool .
wait . watch . here comes dad .
my pleasure .
who 's gon na make trouble ? hey , amigo !

two years ago . march .
good idea . to peggy lee .
we were just having a little discussion about morality .
shut up , frank .
this 'll kill 'em .
all right .

you look great , castor . really . here -- i got a shot of your favorite -- mescal . even has the worm .
yeah -- me .
let me have a look .
retching and convulsing while those bastards didn 't even try to save her sorry ass . you gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution .
an nsa surgeon gave me castor 's face . he handled the transplant , the vocal implant , everything . but somehow castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission . but not before he was transformed into me .
you 've given me the freedom i haven 't had in years , and the power to make it pay off in ways i never thought possible . but hell -- this is america . one day a pauper , the next day , a prince . and i owe it all to you . now if you 'll excuse me , i 've got an important government job to abuse , -- and a beautiful wife to fuck . excuse me -- i mean `` make love to . ''
vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn 't take long .
five seconds .
not if i kill you first ...
trust me , he 's already here . get going !
janie ?
yeah , mom cut me some slack -- but i decided ... i 'd like to be here for you . here , mom . you can have it back . thanks , though .
you better get used to it . that bitch lazarro is getting kicked upstairs . guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her ?
no problem .
-- i 've got to study .
they say love is blind . do you think that 's true ?
good . because i 'm fed up .
sure , baby -- go anywhere you want . but i have to give you an escort . security reasons .
i don 't know . maybe ...
youre jumping , sweetheart ...
mommy needs five more minutes in la la land . that could be her present ...
im not worried , mom . hes still learning our ways ...
i read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays ...
kates my wife ...

damn , you are the real thing ...
i call all you white guys `` jack . ''
wait a minute , wait a minute ... you 're tryin ' to save me ?
what the hell is happening to me ? !
look jack , in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it ... let it come to you .
do i look like i live in a bottle ?
you know what the word glimpse means , j ? its by nature an impermanent thing .
get out , i call 911 .
well do whatever it is you do well , and just ... just do it . excuse me ...
nice night for it . i 'll have louis send your car home .
thanks . to you too ...
okay , chief .
you hear me complaining about that ?
i dont know ! please stop yelling at me !
funny , jack . im laughing on the inside .
well thats just great ... those little monkeys can be a real handful ...
that is the general idea , yes ...
its an unbelievable thing . wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person . im gon na buy it ...
i cant believe its not a disappointment to you ! jesus , kate , i couldve been a thousand times the man i became . how could you do this to me ? how could you let me give up on my dreams like this ? !
long , boring , and generally pretty sad . arnie seemed to enjoy it ... hey , wheres that chocolate cake ... ?
but im gettin close , right ?
ill just full yours up to the top . happy anniversary , sweetheart .
thats all i wanted to hear ...
what are you talking about , jack ?
we have two kids , annie and josh ...
but youre not interested in boutique dollars ... i get it ...
youre a little tougher , peter .
im sorry , no ...
so we 'll get egg nog .
i 've got plenty of places to go .
if it 's something you feel strongly about .
yes !
you wouldn 't say that , if you could see me .
i 'm blind , not deaf . wan na come in ?
i like the sound of that .
you 'd never know it .
if we 're going to identify the source of the mutation , we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes .
this isn 't permanent , johnny . we need to be careful until we 're normal again .
ben , i don 't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse . i need you to be patient for a little while longe --
give me the god damn mirror !
hey , i 'm mr . sensitivity now . clear the way , wide load coming through .
just get back soon , or i start looking for a new groom .
out front ? you home , baby ? i got a surprise for you .
deb , it 's me . it 's still me .
i already got it . everything i want .
i 'll schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
is it safe ?
well why didn 't you say so ? you want me to lift some weights or something ?
that 's terrible news ...
ben , are you there ?
you 've been working out .
what he 's trying to say is : every team needs a mascot ...
oh , it is .
keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
johnny .
showtime .
recording , sir . we see you perfectly .
later . first , i 've got some unfinished business . a deal that needs closing ...
not at all .
hilarious .
reed , we 're running out of time .
it 's too late for him , and soon it 'll be too late for all of us .
never better .
i was talking about us . working together .
it 's been changed .
well , he 's welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny ...
no way to know . without more tests , experiments .
i gave him twenty .
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
no ...
they 'll make up some time , once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity . respiration post ...
i can 't help it . i 'm just weak , i guess .
it means killing benes ... and for all we know , they may have completed the operation ! damn it to hell !
the pentagon , wasn 't it , general ? only you weren 't in that uniform ...
here 's the surgeon .
no question of her loyalty .
oh yes , i 've heard of you , doctor .
why don 't you go on . we 'll meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes .
no danger of attack , as long as you don 't trigger them off by any injury to the system .
yes , there 's no time to spare . and those fibers can be quite tenacious .
but big enough for us ...
i don 't know yet , doctor . and i won 't know until i test it .
he certainly is . he should be up and about in no time .
now i know ...
i always thought it was nothing but red .
and if it should take more time to get through --
doctor -- is it possible ? that we 're seeing it happen before our eyes ?
but i did . i 'm positive !
i have no idea .
i can 't till the hatch is flooded !
look ! they follow the direction of her glance , are startled to see :
captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it .
we have no alternative . with only six minutes left , we 'll just barely make it .
they all lead to the same place -- the lungs .
no , there 's no other way .
if i can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels ...
how are you , miss peterson ?
yes ... we can go forward on this course , but it means going directly through the heart .
if those corpuscles can take on air , no reason why we can 't . all we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about , and when benes inhales , there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank . how 's that sound to you , skipper ?
there 's no other way . tie my safety line to the sub .
walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales .
reticular fibers . we ought to be clear of them soon .
no , we should reach the base of the brain shortly . and from there , it 's not far to the site of the injury .
we can get out through the lab section .
i 'll guide you , once we 're in the heart .
yeah , i just came in . i decided not to park here .
unghh ... oh , geez ...
or your fucking wife , jerry .
jezhush .
we split that .
hold on ! no fuckin ' way ! you fuckin ' notish ish ? i got fuckin ' shot inna faish ! i went'n got ta fuckin ' money ! i get shot fuckin ' pickin ' it up ! i been up for thirty-shiksh fuckin ' hourzh ! i 'm takin ' that fuckin ' car ! that fuckerzh mine !
oh , for christ 's sake , where 's my goddamn checkbook . let 's get this over with .
oh , yah ?
okay , i want you to tell me what these fellas looked like .
hold on .
i 'm sorry , sir , i -
now come on here , no way , wade ! no way !
yah ...
aw , norm .
just a diet coke .
love ya , margie .
marla ?
it suits you .
don 't worry , i 'm leaving .
goodbye .
then , i 'll have the clam chowder ... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie .
okay , if that 's what it takes , you 'll never have to see me again . here ... here ...
yes , fine . just , get on . stay away a couple of weeks , at least .
yes .
you fucking slut ! !
you 're a tourist . i saw you at melanoma , tuberculosis and testicular cancer .
don 't watch . i can 't if you watch .
like hell . that counted .
my dad . no question .
uh ... nah ...
no , what you 're feeling is premature enlightenment .
i heard . local 15 , monday nights .
tell him !
i felt like destroying something beautiful .
wait a minute ...
but , when you fall asleep , i do things without you ...
this is not about martyrdom .
green ? did you say green ?
it 's the only way to get rid of you ...
i hope you 're ready for this .
i ... i ...
no , it 's not here . this one was different . more like the pile up and the van going into the lake .
i have to save eugene !
holy shit . he said `` only new life can defeat death . '' if she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born , a brand new soul that was never part of death 's design ...
taken care of .
your entire world view just went out the window . i couldn 't expect a religious conversation overnight . we 'll get through this . i promise .
being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in death 's design .
blow me .
yeah , you should have specified .
blow me . yellow means go , kimberly .
blow me . yellow means go , kimmy .
take my van !
yeah , i hate to love and leave ya , but i 've been over this x-files shit since the sixth season .
evan shaeffer 's dead .
he can 't breathe damn it . i think his lung 's collapsed !
i know how it feels to be dead .
i know . i can feel it too .
yeah , don 't make me cite you for harassment .
there 's going to be a huge accident ! everyone 's gon na die . all of us ! i saw it !
there 's going to be a huge accident ! everyone 's gon na die , all of us , i saw it !
i don 't know what 's weirder , the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance .
i love you too , dad . goodnight .
i know , we 'll be there soon .
who am i , david blane ?
he 's not a witch .
yeah , but everything 's always in transition . if you focus , even now , one week into summer ... you can feel autumn coming . almost like bein ' able ... to see the future .
most kids never have it happen .
they blame me for everything . her , tod , the plane crash ...
easy , billy , just open it .
i wish you were on the plane !
look , there 's something you should all know .
dude , get wisdom . we 're about to board a seven hour flight . the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets . what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake ? you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes ?
no ... i can 't . as long as i 'm in here , it 's outta my control .
no harm . no foul .
whatta ' you whinin ' about ? he said i 'm next .
they 're watching me , see if i go to alex .
you have a responsibility to tell me .
star wars ?
no .
where 's your stuff ?
there 's a compass in the handle .
fermented fish sauce .
who cares ? let 's just do it and get out . go have a jacuzzi and get laid in bangkok . know what i mean ?
nothing we can do , man .
duck soup .
how much we got left in that minigun ?
it means `` virgin . '' my mother was comedian .
sure . i only sound like forty-year- old in your language .
where 's his father ?
took bus , most of way . i knew you would come here .
it doesn 't hurt . why doesn 't it hurt ?
i was crossed-trained in gunships .
couple hours . let me buy you a coffee .
of course not . you can 't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after tehran .
i could take it or leave it .
this just occurred to somebody , now ?
ah ... i do them myself . i used to work in a beauty parlor .
do i look like i have someone special ?
the nails ! ! watch the nails ! ! ... listen , you still have to eat .
okay . ... i love you ...
oh , i got a pimple ... this stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color ... like it really works , ya know ...
thank you very much .
well..everything 's closed up . we thought we 'd get some dinner . say ! ... .anybody up for chinese ? have you eaten ? would you like to come along ?
no , it 's not ... come here ...
huh-huh ... .you son of a bitch !
i 'm a man with a mission , jack .
yes . hi..congratulations . jack lucas . nice to meet you finally . this is anne napolitano , the owner of video spot .
well..um ... you get an official membership card ... just sign that and we 'll laminate it right here ... parry ? you want to laminate miss sinclair 's card ? ...

thanks a mill -- and i 'll give you a buzz as soon as i hear from the people upstairs and we 'll get this thing off the ground ... thanks for stopping by , jack . give my love to the wife and kids .
you 're totally gone , aren 't you ?
it 's a classic .
i know !
bingo ! tell the man what he 's won !
you won 't be alone for long .
well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances ...
well , i 'm in search of the holy grail .
look at these assholes ! what the hell are they doing ? !
i got accused a robbin ' a fillin'station down in the indian nation , didn ' i tell you ...
i 'm too moved by your gentility to speak .
yeah , great . why don 't you throw z 's for 19 frames , and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game ? just wonderful .
you 'll be gone , period .
oh , you 're not going to kill yourself this time . i wish i 'd known ...
i don 't , huh ?
fill it up .
okay , i 'll make it as easy for you as i can . give me an omelette , plain , and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter , no mayonnaise , no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee .
don 't , then .
wait ...
i don 't think you should infer daddy was wrong in front of him ...
a couple of months .
yeah , well , he 's ...
you know , he was formerly a sailor .
sailors are sadistic , i feel .
can 't i have anything to myself , dammit ? !
then after that ?
yes , that 's what 's important to me ...

yeah , i think i could .

artartartartmooneymooneymooney mooney .
yeah , ford . i 'm okay .
an asshole ? a swine ? a ballistic turd ? pick one . i never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and i had to take over the company . you see the music is irrelevant in this industry . i 'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick ' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with .
go on , another time , another place .
oh , wait . one sec . open the window .
oh please , ford , i 'll do any --
fuck you , santa claus !

he was the bank on that shipment outta mexico three years ago .
sixty days . here . don 't mention it .

there 's a manhole at canal and bowery .
i 'm alright , gibby .
then fuckin ' find it . i 'm going for the girl .

they 'll question her . whatever they tell her could change what happens . no , i want you to follow her . see if anybody 's watching her , hittin ' on her . i 'm betting somebody 's gon na walk outta that bar with her . when they do , you call the cops .
well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer .
you there ?
h-hi .
hang on .
dad , you there ?
just a minute , john ... okay ? don 't go away .
we did it , john . we stopped him .
what the hell is that smell ?
i think it 's somewhere in the closet ... if you can find it .
whoa , i just ... i just ...
gordo , i wasn 't dreaming . i talked to him , it was real .
yeah . that 's it .
that wasn 't luck , johnny boy . that was smarts and ten plus on the job .
mind if i shake it off first ... so 's i can concentrate better .
just cause he didn 't want to look at the photos doesn 't mean he isn 't the doer . not everyone fits the profile .
hey , ma , it 's me . checking in . probably at work . anyways , i 'll see you tomorrow night . love you .
yeah , that 's right .
yes , you can . come on , shelly !
we were looking for something to keep our hands busy . it was either this or an orgy . vera chose this . what 're ya gon na do ?
maybe this wasn 't such a good idea .
you can play with yourself , 'cause i 'm going in the house .
if you insist .
i 'll think of something .
sure .
yes , man !
this is all the exercise i need ...
okay , we won 't . we 'll just have fun , all agreed ?
are you all right , shelly ?
why don 't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset . it 'll mellow you out .
sure , just watch where you 're going .
destroy the evidence , pronto !
just keep your eyes on the road .
look at it this way ... things can only get better ... right ?
a few minor repairs and it 'll be as good as new .
great . just great .
no way ... ... i wan na rock !
we 're gon na scare him ? !
stay cool ? you ain 't dirty harry . now stop it .
it 's a damn company executive game , and she 's a damn company exec .
all he 's asking is for you to check it out .
yes , megan . tommy jarvis is a killer . a very deranged boy who wants you to believe that ...
okay . there 's one .
what 's it to ya ?
i hope so .
no , he was real . like on tv .
no more .
who ya calling ?
we 'll scare 'em right back .
yeah , we 're here .
they were gon na ! but some asshole sent a lot of money to give jason and his mother a decent burial . now look , you just lie down and get some rest . in the morning i 'll call that clinic and see if they ...
if i had you where i really wanted you , they 'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde .
yeah ... they should 've paid their bill .
yeah , that 'd be a big shame ...
yes .
okay , i 'll call you later .
that 's what i 'd like to know .
i was going to , i was going to tell everyone . i just ... didn 't expect to be back here so soon . is steven around ?
yeah . sit down a second . there 's something i need to tell you about steven ...
relax , i 've got mcculloch covered ... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter . rumor has it she 's a teensy bit afraid of the water ...
ask me in about five minutes .
rennie 's not coming .
don 't be ridiculous !
nothing .
i packed it . just for us .
charles , there 's someone else coming along too .
oh , i can see that . you 've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids , miss van deusen .
where is she ?
oh dear god ...
he 's the son of the captain , for chrissakes . you 'd think he 'd be able to operate this thing !
nothing ! i went to her cabin and ...
a wonderful choice of places to dock a boat , mr. robertson .
i 'm staying .
i want to go home . i want off this ship .
what do you mean ? ? ?
just radio for help , okay ? ? ?
drugs ... then jason came . he 's here , sean .
please , hurry ...
where you 're going , mister ?
there 's nothing left for me to lie about .
daddy , wait .
it 's only our first date .
names are incredibly intimate . we barely know each other . trust me on this .
yes .
this place becomes famous . tour buses . blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall .
i respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi . but let 's put a lid on the questions .
they 're always winning . until they lose .
it 's a test all right . they 're bringing in stanley .
you 're out of bullets .
you 're not making sense .
but i know you , don 't i ? i seen you on a poster in the theater district . i 'll think of your name in just a --
i 'm actually beginning to enjoy this .
i 'm going home to my machine .
they are boys . -- and they 're indian .
there 's no room ! and the air is lovely .
`` i will follow close behind you and help to serve the people . ''
not without defeats -- and great pain . but are there no defeats in this war -- no pain ? what you can not do is accept injustice . from hitler -- or anyone . you must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so .
i 'm simply going to prove to muslims there , and hindus here , that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that 's where all our battles ought to be fought .
ah , but my puritanism runs the another way . i 'm far too modest for such a display .
no , no -- just a moment , please .
i think if we all worked to publicize it ... all of the congress ... every avenue we know .
panditji -- please , help me .
it would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing .
not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand . it is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns .
my name is walk-er . and i intend to report it the way it is .
you should ride the pony . it is not necessary to walk to prove the point .
well , i 've called you here because i 've had a chance to see the new legislation . it 's exactly what was rumored . arrest without warrant . automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious ...
that was england .
don 't worry -- i 've never seen men so determined . you 've given them a way to fight ... and i don 't think --
thank you . no .
somehow i expected not .
yes , sir . the day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of `` free india . '' then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt .
have you found him ?
bapu -- please . where are you going .
don 't worry . you 'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb . we can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon .
this time i will supervise each test personally .
i will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission . we 're already counting backwards .
at least you 're honest . call me by my middle name -- eugene -- if you 're going to be jerome , you may as well start getting used to it .
listen , i bag this stuff anyway . it may as well pay my rent .
you 're right , there 's more atmosphere where you 're going .
keep going ! ! keep going ! !
you know i 'm scared of heights .
they are not babies , maria , merely `` human possibilities '' .
no it can 't be verified . yes i was alone .
you celebrate , jerome ?
of course .
i guess somebody beat me to it .
not so long -- just once around the sun .
antonio --
small town , small bank , big money .
sure .
suit yourself .
if we are clean gollie will take us over at nogales . if we are hot we 'll have to try laughlin at el paso .
i 've never `` been there ... when we met it was in his office .
you bastard ...
if i hadn 't killed beynon. , you would have .
i 'll tell you something , doc . one day you 're going to have to trust somebody ...
it 's all a game , don 't bother me .
yeah .
sure ...
pull over .
tell her you robbed a bank ...
i kinda doubt it .
sure thing , mister , it 's coming right up . 'bout an hour . quiet crossing that is .
don 't worry about me , i 'll grab a cab ... i can afford it , you know .
just ... tell us what you want .
after you come back i 'll listen while you make some phone calls , tell a few friends you 've got to leave for a week or two ... you have to call another vet about the animals . you tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow ... no slip-ups on that . they got to be looked after ...
i know .
yes , but listen . christ , i didn 't kill him .
you 're a big man , but you 're in bad shape . with me , it 's a full- time job . now behave yourself .
i had to . it was the only way i could get at them .
killed ? i don 't know anything about it .
he won 't . he thinks i 'm simple .
especially when i play the lead .
how 'd you find me ?
up the stairs , keith . the door on the right .
don 't ask me .
sod off .
the gun he means .
shut up .
harry ! jack , i don 't want to be rude , but these men have brought a lot of money with them . glenda , you don 't offer a man like jack a drink in those piddling little glasses . give him the bloody bottle . now , where are we ?
calling my bluff , are you , harry ?
shut up .
what could we get for them ? i don 't know . buck a throw ... buck-a- half a throw ... i don 't know ... hey , who knows what they 're worth , what do they pay for them ? all told ... must be , i 'd ... three bucks a throw ... i don 't know .
have i said that ?
how ya doing ?
what do you care ... ?
down the street .
what ?
fuck . i had them on river glen .
we had a robbery .
'cause , you know , 'cause they weren 't , i know that mitch and murray uh ...
i didn 't ... why should i ... '' where were you last ... '' is anybody listening to me ... ? where 's moss ... ? where ... ?
i 'm going to the chinks . you 're done , come down , we 're going to smoke a cigarette .
that was easy , wasn 't it ?
will you shut up , i 'm telling you this ...
what does that mean ?
shut the fuck up . ricky . you have a mean streak in you ... and what the fuck are you babbling about ... ?
jim ! what are you doing here ? jim lingk , d. ray morton ...
i 've got to get ray to o'hare ... come on , let 's hustle ... john ! call american express in pittsburgh for mr. morton , will you , tell them he 's on the one o'clock .
it 's a common reaction , jim . i 'll tell you what it is , and i know that that 's why you married her . one of the reasons is prudence . it 's a sizable investment . one thinks twice ... it 's also something women have . it 's just a reaction to the size of the investment . monday , if you 'd invite me for dinner again ... this woman can cook ...
some of them ...
'cause i don 't have to eat this month . no . okay . give 'em to me ... fucking mitch and murray going to shit a br ... what am i going to do all ...
well i 'm going to worry about it , and so are you , so shut up and listen . i get his action . my stuff is mine , whatever he gets for himself , i 'm talking half . you put me in with him .
oh yes , the very best .
if you like , why not give me fifty dollars each to pay fanucci . i guarantee he will accept that amount from me .
go on , answer him when he talks to you . tell him : columbus , marconi ... garibaldi .
a hundred years ... it 's a toast .
i 'm getting out of here i said ; these guys all have guns !
mike , what can i do , she 's a hysterical woman ...
forget it , just go take care of her .
you know her ; drives me crazy , one minute she 's a popsicle , the next she 's all vinegar . sometimes i think ... i think - i should a married someone , like you did . to have kids , to have a family .
nowhere , mike . i wanted to get a refill . how about you ?
just tell rocco i 'm waiting .
no . but if they do have somebody , you 'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name .
roth engineered it , michael . he made pentangeli think you hit him . deliberately letting him get off alive . then the new york detectives turned frankie over to the fbi . my informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him . anyway , they had him on possession , dealing in heroin , murder one and a lot more . there 's no way we can get to him and you 've opened yourself to five points of perjury .
your plans are a little different this time . you skip miami , and go straight to geneva . it 's to be deposited to this number . and it 's got to be there by monday morning , no slip-up .
thanks , tom . thanks .
actually , i 've come with good news ; the corleone family has done you a favor .
it means ... & quot ; the lie. & quot ;
there was this kid that i grew up with ; he was a couple years younger than me , and sort of looked up to me , you know . we did our first work together , worked our way out of the street . things were good and we made the most of it . during prohibition , we ran molasses up to canada and made a fortune ; your father too . i guess as much as anyone , i loved him and trusted him . later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for g.i . 's on the way to the west coast . that kid 's name was moe greene , and the city he invented was las vegas . this was a great man ; a man with vision and guts ; and there isn 't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town . someone put a bullet through his eye ; no one knows who gave the order . when i heard about it i wasn 't angry . i knew moe ; i knew he was headstrong , and talking loud , and saying stupid things . so when he turned up dead , i let it go , and said to myself : this is the business we 've chosen . i never asked , who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business .
sure , i remember tom from the old days .
yes .
keep them alive .
sitting right behind you .
sure you 're free , for now at least . but how long before you 're just alone ? pathetic and alone .
the master is waiting for you .
that 's okay , hanna . i 'm more comfortable in here . it is hanna , isn 't it ?
i put him to bed . he 's not there ?
excellent . we 'll have a most interesting time .
that 's exactly what i intend to do .
i 'd like to sit for you again . but only if you ease up on the locker room talk . okay ?
catch my death .
your friend ?
what 'd you say ?
relax , clayton . i can 't hear you . i can 't hear a word .
no , i don 't want to die alone . but to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable . they say you never see the one with your name on it . but i want to see death coming at me . i want it to be sharp and hard , with a human face . your face . think , clayton . you 'd be my second monster . almost as famous as the first . it would be the great adventure you 've yearned for . a war story for both of us to share .
all right .
you ever hear of this whale fellow ?
good . fine .
i just want to watch it , okay ?
the monster 's lonely and he wants a friend , a girlfriend , somebody . what sick about that ?
i thought i 'd give you a hand since i kept you open .
oh , david , stop being a nanny .
oh dear .
good-bye . so nice to see you ...
bone ? boom ? something bee . i hire him while you were in the hospital . he came cheap .
luminal .
my mind 's lovely . and yours ?
don 't be silly , hanna . he 's a very proper actor . and the dullest fellow imaginable .
no , hanna . my heart isn 't that black .
a visitor .
it must be up in your old room . i will look .
nice . and your lighting and camera angles . you 're got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it .
no . i never said you were . or will be soon .
you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago . nobody cared a tinker 's cuss who slept with whom , so long as you kept it out of the papers . outside of hollywood , who knows who george cukor is , much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica ?
i just need to -- lie down . studio . daybed in studio .
point-five ...
yes ... kip ...
i don 't want him hurt ...
were it only that easy . i have obligations . the order needs to be filled ...
they gave me two weeks . i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew , who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost , but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor , making this even more difficult to achieve ...
`` don 't want '' the dodgers to lose or the summer to end . but we don 't get to choose these things ...
but i had to . it was the only way to get to you --
i don 't know . but you shouldn 't be here . take care of your business . i 'll give you 24 hours . and then i don 't want to see your face . ever again . make a fool of me once , that 's my bad . make a fool of me twice . that 's really my bad , and i 'll kick your ass from here to india ...
needs brightening ...

who else ? paulie got the okay . this little guinea fuck . someday he 's gon na be a boss . can you believe someday we 'll work for him .
you 're some fucking jerk .
i remember feeling bad about the guy . but i remember feeling that maybe tuddy was right . i knew paulie didn 't want anybody dying in the building .
they 're okay and it 's worth it . ain 't it ?
nothing . i dropped the soap . that 's all .
no , he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home . fuckin ' lights and everything !

shut the fuck up .
you thought we forgot , didn 't you ? i know i 'm gettin ' my licks in .
there 's no problem . i was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies . my contention is that prior to the revolutionary war the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and ...
it 's touching me .
the limit is not found ! the limit is not found .
yeah , when do i get my hypnosis ? you guys been talkin ' for twenty minutes .
i appreciate that .
you guys are fuckin ' sick .

i guess .
yeah . i guess we did .
you too .
see you in ten years .
well , a 'course , taxes provide your basic service -- police and whatnot . but our customers need a little more than just that , you understand ? this badge doesn 't mean that i am a peace officer .
excuse me , with all due respect , but this is her decision , not yours . and i don 't want to waste anybody 's time -- mostly mine .
don 't be so sure it 's my last . there are a few people back home i 'd like to put under a red hot iron .
just polite . well , maybe you 'd like to try riding again , some time before you go home .
she was never really happy here . she did the best she could .
tom .

how thoughtful of you . and what if i decide not to go ?
why ?
i don 't want to lie down . i 've been lying down enough .
okay .
what are you asking me for ? you didn 't ask me if i wanted to come in the first place -- now i get to decide ? forget it !
little .
i think they call it a pasture .
wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves ...
tom 's gone .
exactly ...
all right . speak to you then .
yeah . bye .
oh . right . i 'll call him .
robert , we 're losing her . we 're losing her . i don 't care what the doctors say . the truth is , they don 't know anymore than we do -- less , when it comes to grace ... this may not sound sensible or ... logical , but nobody 's suggesting anything better . i can 't explain it , robert . i just have this feeling ... this annoying ... bloody feeling that if ... if , somehow , pilgrim can be made all right ... then so can grace . i just know it !
we have a business manager . the best around .
absolutely . i made enough for an army .
would you mind if i did ? i 'd like to talk to him .
it 's fine . comfortable . i still can 't get used to how dark it gets around here , though . when we leave the ranch , i always hold my breath until i can see the motel .
oh , you can just set up on the dining table . i have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow .
oh , it 's ... i wanted to tell you that , if you 'd like , you being so busy , i could take grace to her therapy exercises for you . i have to go in once a week for shopping anyway .
you too , diane .
what , they ain 't going forty miles into choteau everytime they want a hamburger .
well , that 's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from new york .
no thanks .
be honest , i can 't say i did it all myself . my grandma helped me get the words right .
we should be fine , then .
and next time , miss annie , you can run down the calves ...
twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch .
because it fits my head . you want to try it on ?
not to me . either you want to or you don 't .
you 're catching on .
there 's no hurry . take you time .
i just could never say it !
why don 't we just cut through the woods ?
we already did the river . let 's go down and across the old bridge . we can circle back .
no , wait , it just goes ... `` he said he liked to do- '' ...
ok , ok .
no , i 'm just not that hungry .
maybe ... look -- just ...
no !
i did . he said he had work to do until late .
i understand ...
i haven 't been back in over twenty years , but i wouldn 't be surprised . the population 's larger .
see , we 're very busy . a tv network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show .
the red book . nsa trusted networks . otherwise known as the ugly red book that won 't fit on a shelf .
what is it with this guy ?
again ? yeah sure .
yo , man , you an amateur , man .
wait a minute , the fourteenth , that 's the same day the worm ends its run . i mean ... da vinci virus , didn 't phreak say that 's what he was being charged with ? look ... `` infecting ballast programs of ellingson tankers '' - they blame hackers !
no , don 't know who he is . do you ?
this is the end , my friend . thank you for calling !
burn !
joey 's getting stupid busy .
pool on the roof must have a leak .
i got a record . i was zero cool .
well , we have fifty passwords , plus whatever polaroid head here got inside ellingson .

i 'm trying to help you .
yeah .
dreams ?
cancer ?
run anti-virus . give me a systems display !
you 're hopeless , man , utterly hopeless .
i 'm sorry , we 're sorry , just checking out your fly laptop !
relax , burn , he 's my guest .
well luckily , you have a gifted and talented security officer . i traced the hacker 's call . the secret service picked him up this morning . i 'll just search his files for the original virus code , and then i can eliminate it .
you don 't owe me anything .
no , you don 't understand .
she 's not dead !
loomis , it 's over . leave it alone .
look , even if by some miracle michael is conscience , his muscles would be totally useless . give the troopers a chance to search .
honey , this tie has a spot on it , i can 't wear this today . i got a 10:30 with chuck .
i 've said this before . i think your the one who needs medical help .
if loomis read memos he 's be here . fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical . my hope is that he 's either transfer , retire , or die .
you dumb son of a bitch , you said you saw myers .
you bet .
yeah , hurry up .
real soon , jamie . now shh .
no .
all right . good good . logan i want you right here by the front door . this is the dead bolt key .
all right .
hi jamie .
i 'll be there in 5 minutes .
least i 'm not alone .
yes .
they didn 't know what they were fighting .
let it be earl . let the police handle it .
you haven 't got a police force ! these men may be the only defense you 've got .
they 've survived this ordeal , they 'll survive it 's memory .
what 's going on ?
calm down . calm down . are you all right ? are you all right ?
huh ?
he shouts , too .
okay . bye .
no , he 's not .
lindsey , open the door ! i 'm locked in the laundry room !
and i can 't keep you interested ?
are you sure ?
michael 's around someplace ...
lee brackett .
could have ...
he isn 't a man .
the only reason she babysits is to have a place to ...
i don 't think so ...
totally .
see you .
no ! do as i say .
i can 't believe it !
well , let 's hope so .
uh --
i mean , i 've looked everywhere .
no , really , we mustn 't get discouraged .
mmm .
oh , it 's magnificent !
yeah .
i mean , it 's jammed . if we went ... um ...
ah ! holly now .
i 'm an architect .
well ...
right . yeah , but fifth is so jammed , isn 't it ?
this time i really think i have something .
oh , that 's nice .
oh , that 's nice . i 'd love to see her wind up settled . she 's a tense one .
yes , he 's just adorable .
yes , it made me cry it was so beautiful ... so romantic .
oh , please , i have to go . i have to get my teeth cleaned .
i promised myself i wouldn 't let this happen till you were living alone . i was so torn when you called .
i know it isn 't .
oh , all the time .
i don 't know . um ... i 'm just antsy .
it 's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return !
you 're not lost .
and we drink to her , and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year ... her great success in a doll 's house !
i am glad to see you .
always .
it 's on the table , dad .
how can we be happy ?
oh , no , no , no . he 's my sister 's husband . and i think if you gave him half a chance , you 'd like him . he 's very intelligent .
they 're in the basement .
oh , frederick !
you know ...
well , i don 't realize it now , i know it all the time , but , but i managed to stick it in the back of my mind ...
you are , holly . stop it .
two minutes on your sons ' birthday . you know , it 's not going to kill you .
oh , sure .
yeah .
she really does , though .
oh , your kids are so adorable .
well , i think he was dying to open up . it 's so sad . now ... what should i wear to my audition ?
no ! no , i , eh , it 's just that they sing .
look , everything 's going your way .
but what i decided to do is some writing . yeah , i think i 've had it with acting . you know , these meaningless auditions at cattle calls . and i can 't handle another rejection . now let 's face it here . i got ta , you know , latch on to something in my life . you know -- something with a future . i 'm not sixteen anymore . it 's just ... crazy ! i 've got ... an idea for a story . more than one . and i just need a few months , you know , or , uh , a year even .
hey , hannah , i know i 'm mediocre .
i 'm real upset about what you wrote .
yeah , we 're having some problems , but problems that are my business ... which i don 't see how you could know about in such detail . how does lee know about these things ? how ? they 're private !
you want some ?
but , no , you 've been doing that all night ! you 're gon na ... you 're gon na burn a hole in your ... you 're gon na develop a third nostril ! really , don 't , please .

i don 't get it ! you were wrong ! i was right ! strength , damnit ! come back !
no-o !
you want to wipe the slate clean as much as i do . okay , so maybe i am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me . you have a purpose though ! remember ? let 's face it , the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven .
heather was cool , but cruel . the good looks and bad manners gave her power , but it could not give her happiness .
we 're pretty handy with model making , too , eh ?
well . . . i better make myself a bit more presentable .

if you reach out , you could get pulled over yourself .
half the time he don 't answer even if he 's home . know why ? 'cause he don 't want no bill collectors to find him . i don 't mean to be judgmental , but he 's a scumbag . he don 't have no friends . who 's gon na like a creep like laplante ? i was doin ' him a favor on the tv outta kindness , and he screwed me . you know what color skin you get on my set , miss gayley ? purple ! that 's what color skin you got on the tee vee laplante sells me !
i think we should talk first .
bye , neil !
holly -- that 's not so .
he 'll never appreciate it more .
`` we don 't want to be late for our first day of school . ''
honey , nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them , well , we might have to make a counter offer . but we can 't look too eager or we 'll get screwed .
it 's very nice , but it 's still a little pricey for us .
fuck you , philip .
honey , i 'm sorry , i think the vacation will be a good break for both of us . you 'll see .
there might be some extras in the garage .
we 'll talk in the morning .
shut up .
do you have enough money ?
would you mind if rudolf had a look too ?
i didn 't .
can we keep him ?
get on the other side of that .
yes .
yeah -- how 'd you know that ?
is that it ?
most people are afraid of death .
hey -- somebody want to gim me a hand here ?
aye .
perhaps -- but if i must face it , let it find me , for i shall search for it no more .
would'st you harm one who comes to aid you ?
i lied .

i didn 't know he would have a gun ! it just went off !
that 's why we tied him , dumbass . now come here and see this --
i 've been carrying you our whole fuckin ' lives .
i 'm not going to die for this !
we 'll burn this fuckin ' place down ! i got gasoline all over in here !
i 'm going to put on an officer named will maddox . you talk to him for a while .
we can 't forget it . the sheriffs think you won 't let me talk to smith because he 's dead . they think you murdered him .
only if you try to grab me . we could 've shot you from the wall .
give up , dennis . let these people go . at least you 'll have your life .
you can 't run with suitcases .
you fucked up , glen .
first my girls . i get my girls , you get the other disk .
if you shoot me , he 'll kill your daughter . do you want to lose both of them ?
we 'll see you in a couple of hours .
i know .
how about dog shit ?
kevin 's gone , your daddy 's gone , everybody 's gone .
stop it .
ain 't gon na happen . we 've got unequal pupilation . he could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both .
laura martin . this is will maddox , the primary negotiator --
you 've been here all day , chief . take a break . see your family . if i need you , i 'll call .
thomas smith . i 'm in the house that 's on tv . dennis hit my dad and now he won 't wake up . you got ta help him .

he 's going to kill you . don 't you know that ? he can 't take the chance that you 'll talk .
cockroaches ?
of course .
i 'll be back .
where is your family ?
there is nothing to it .
you want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for captain naramunju .
please , general , call and put your policemen back at the gate .
just give me a moment to get your keys .
i saw the sign .
take it for christ sake . i wish it was a fucking aeroplane .
the guest list . it hasn 't been updated since the murder of the president .
they have him in the lobby , go quickly .
they will surely kill us here . it 's over here . we have to take the chance .
homework ?
dawn . then they go .
get in .
no . they are not dead . stop this .
it 's alright . this is the only place i can find some peace .
a kiss .
i will follow on the next plane . go .
paul ! then another voice .
we are almost out of everything .
boss , some of those men are my neighbors , they know i 'm tutsi .
sir , no one wants to work . they say the boss has left .
open up the ballroom , we 'll put them there . and zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it .
it 's true , sir , the water has been turned off .
i do not know , sir . i think they will kill us all .
paul , do everything you can to buy time . i will call you back .
name 's pritchett . watson pritchett . i own the house , my father built it . and now i just need to get you into it . so ...
not at all !
it was on my dad 's list of `` things to do . '' but the house did him first .
yeah ... something .
c'mon .
a very , very scary game . but then look at the bright side : if there 's only one of you still upright at dawn , you 'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket .
donald w. blackburn , m.d .
well , until that 's found , i think it 's a good idea we all stick together . or wouldn 't that fit into your plans , baby ?
as a tumor .
yeah , me too .
and i think that 's case --
nonsense ! just bad press . all the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father 's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents .
you 'll never know 'til you walk through that door !
i lied . the house is alive and we 're all gon na die .
the soul of the house . everything that 's corrupt about it ... my father trapped it in there just before he died . you see , he purchased the house to restore it ... we were going to live here ... nothing can live here . i was just a kid ... the first time i saw it , i thought it was beautiful ... it was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room ... then it started to move ... then death started to happen ... first the workers.. six in all ... then my father ...
left , goddamnit !
yes .
it 's not going to let us out !
me ? you 've got ta be kidding .
take the gun .
hey , if everybody 's gon na kill each other , could you do it in another room ? i 'm trying to get something accomplished here .
-- listen to the man --
back where ?
it 'll have to do .
he 's dead ... ?
we 're safe ?
for chrissake give me a hand !
cheer up : before the night 's through , i 'm sure one of us 'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something .
i hope not .
how 'd you make your guest list , price : throw darts at a phone book ?
only one way i can think of , sweetheart .
steven ? ?
not the plates : the house . why is no one listening to me ? ? it 's alive ! and once it 's made up its mind , it won 't let anything out .
thank god -- i was afraid i 'd be lynched without a quorum .
i am .
-- i wouldn 't worry , ms. jenzen : the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long . in the meantime , let 's all relax , have a drink , the evening 's young --
i think i 'll do what i damn well please .
-- no -- that 's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- i thought it was evelyn --
-- no more --
evelyn , go stir your cauldron or something for a sec .
it better be -- he still owes me $ 25 grand for renting the place for the night ! here , let 's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely !
you say you saw some activity here ?
suppose not .
that poor little girl .
it 's origin is unknown . the symbol does correspond to a dagger i acquired many years ago .
sure .
well i bet you they 're happy .
we 'll have every leprechaun in ireland here honey .
no it won 't - no it won 't !
yes .
ok ...
what do you mean ? mommy ? you 're scaring me !
i 'm ok mommy .
take me to her .
my god , i heard something !
that 's great , honey .
daddy help !
well , that all depends .
ok ok ... we 're just gon na head inside here ...
whatever you say .
ok .
you seem to appreciate the local scenery .
know what ?
no ... no !
she 's at school . we 've tried not to upset her more than she 's been .
you 'll have to settle for turkey .
white meat will be fine ...
did you know her very well ?
i took pity on the poor woman . this house is too big for one person to live alone in ...
aubrey ? it 's mommy .
come back to us honey , don 't be afraid !
come back to us honey !
and you ... are ?
how can i help you ?
well thank you for the offer , but i really have to go .
good night .
hopefully the whole sad chapter is over . and everyone , including your family , will find peace . will i just want to ... thank all of you , for everything you 've done for us .
not really . oh , wait a minute .
not at all , if it can help .
what happened to him ?
it 's nothing to do with me . i wasn 't even with him .
under the underground ? what 's that ? where is ...
right . right !
right .
it 's okay . it 's just someone burned me once .
unh-unh .
oh . like i 'm not an interesting person .
sure . sure . i understand . it 's cool . i mean , we 've got all night .
it was so beautiful ! when the blanks went off , they ...
it doesn 't have to be . everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin , you 'll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails .
oh , not much . mario brothers want me to do a job .
sure . that 's why his meatballs are made out of marinated chuck wagon .
hmmm , nasty little safe on the 7th .
hey , you promised ... ... don 't worry , i 'm wearing my girdle .
yes , master-thief , i can see that . you said something about a plan ...
`` he kicks up at anything he hears .
`` every day you meet quite a few . ''
geez , this art treasures room looks like a burnt diaphragm .
`` maybe we 're ragged and funny . ''
`` but we 'll be the same as we started ...
i don 't want to sound immature , but we were here first ...
it 's boston , mr. mayflower .
fantastic . perfection . the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder .
because danger , doc , is my middle ...
yes , and my giraffe loves it , too ...
i never break a date . scout 's honor .
oh , i must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it .
baseball , why ?
ah , the mafia , the cops ; do i know how to party or what ?
but you 're going to tell us anyway ...
the pleasure 's all yours , officer gates .
for god 's sake , chain this convict .
just browsing . don 't touch me ... .
tell me about it ...
forty-eight years ...
what the heck they doin ' ?
it 's the most beautiful t'ing i ever saw .
i like to think so ! it 's this little idea i been working on !
huh ? ! but , buddy --
buzz ... off ! ha-ha-ha-ha !
i --
sure , sure . and did your classmates there call you 'jerk ' or ... ... 'schmoe ' ?
oh my god , sir !
oh my god , sir !
oh my god , sir !
but , sir !
sir , my leg is on fire !
oh my god , sir !
she looks in her purse ...
thank you .
i would have stayed anyway , dr. maxwell .
it 'll wait .
by a curious coincidence , it 's my day off , too .
did you hear what he sang ?
of course , wes .
yes , thank you .
no , thank you . tomorrow 's time enough for you to begin work .
a woman crying ? no one 's been crying here .
i imagined this so differently ...
emotion tricks all of us , mrs. rand . and you are a woman with a very strong conscience . that conscience has been tormenting you . the rest is coincidence . there is no such thing as a zombie . the dead do not come back to life . death is final .
dr. maxwell has very unpleasant news for us .
that night , i went to the houmfort . i kept seeing jessica 's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart . the drums seemed to be beating in my head . the chanting -- the lights -- everything blurred together . and then i heard a voice , speaking in a sudden silence . my voice . i was possessed . i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie .
hmm . good night .
paul ? yeah . you think --
jesus all right enough !
c'mon .
like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they 've got in this place .
yeah , paul , are you gon na get home okay ?
hey , it 's a sellable skill .
what is it ?
thanks for the advice dad .
i 'm not good at math . just geometry .
then why 'd you come after me ?
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here .
about how long 'til you heard the suspect 's second shot ?
actually ...
don 't worry about him ...
down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in .
why ?
randy stetz . her boyfriend . we 've questioned him , searched his place . didn 't find anything .
has her books in it .
no .
i 'm going to the hospital to talk to him now . you get the search party together . no fewer than thirty people . i 'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes . don 't waste any time .
you know what about .
what are we thinking ?
will ?
long as it 's fun .
kay told me . she comes to me , you know . tells me things . about you . about me .
it was when i went to kiss her . she started laughing . i got angry . after all i 'd given her . all i 'd shared with her . i just wanted to make her stop . that 's all .
like moths around the candle of the age . decadent , useless . they can 't reflect anything . but you do . you reflect its broken heart .
follow me - that way - through my cell -
be glad i made you what you are ! you 'd be dead not if i hadn 't .
no . laudanum .
the way i learn everything . by watching you .
tell me why ... you 've got to tell me ...
don 't mock me , louis . help me .
the one good lesson he taught me , louis . never drink from the dead .
tell me you don 't hate me louis . i did it for you -
not yet .
yes ...
you are neither , claudia . now stop this --
nonsense all right . but something tell me it 's going to be the strangest nonsense we 've ever seen .
they are here . i know they are . listen for something that doesn 't make a sound .
how devilishly clever .
be still !
you really believe that ?
and a beautiful house it is too . yours is a good life , isn 't it ?
why should i be ?
i 've come to answer your prayers . you want to die , don 't you ? life has no meaning anymore , does it ?
i want a woman .
you 've killed louis . and enjoyed it .
we can live like this ? off the blood of animals ?
anything is possible . but just try it for a week . come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport !
i don 't know any hell -
what you wouldn 't do . it 's almost sunrise . it will be the sun or the fire . you said they can kill me . the sun or the fire !
vampires are killers . predators , who 's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment .
i like to do it . i enjoy it . take you aesthete 's taste to purer things . kill them swiftly if you will , but do it ! for now doubt , you are a killer louis . ah !
in the old world , they called it the dark gift , louis . and i gave it to you .
that 's enough , cherie . stop before the heart stops .
louis , louis , i gave you the gift -- - help me -- -
are you mad ? ? ? ?
yes but you needn 't worry about that now . things change .
he was dead to us . we were free . that was all that mattered .
au contraire , monsieur , i have .
my daughter ...
checking in ... karla wilson .
built in 1948 for a member of the rockefeller clan . the tile work was imported from spain . a lot of history in these walls ... judy garland stayed here ... hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
who ? who is here ?
phones went down a few minutes ago .
storm is what makes it interesting . thass why all the fish are up . less hook us a couple big ones .
up-tighteous and self-righteous .
what are you doing in my closet ?
no . when i put these skinny pants on my body ... now , that 's heart attack time .
yet . nothing yet .
nope . i told him that you absolutely , positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight . and then he came anyway .
ray , come on . i want us to be together .
no , i 'm the king of the world .
the dockhand guy . hanging by his neck from up there .
some .
come on , julie . you saw his room .
we 'll be better off in the open . if we stick together , maybe we can kill this creep for good .
what do we do ?
fine . show me the body .
it 's my fault . i shouldn 't have ... i didn 't think ...
it 's in my room !
did you get help ?
come on , i 'll take a break and we 'll all dance .
honey , some folks just can 't fly .
we got ta get out of here . now .
i 'm not hiding up no tree . i 'm with her . let 's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho 's butt .
i don 't know , but i 'm starving .
i said we start having fun . and that means now .
ladies and gentlemen , please put your hands together for my friend , my very best friend , julie james .
he 's probably the only one who can help us .
okay , karla , five seconds . five ... four ...
planter 's punch , singapore sling , or how about a mai-tai ?
so why are you still here ?
estes ! that 's exactly who it is . that old guy knows something . we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first .
yeah , wait right here , it 's the safest place .
that staggering . his dying so quickly . in your campaigns , have you never seen men who staggered before they died , who talked incoherently walked blindly .
i have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say , i believe everything , a little .
very well . i 'll wager a dinner .
i just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you .
i must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him i am not afraid --
i 'll get ida to make up your bed .
m~ father will take care of it . pappa is wonderful ! no matter what happens , he makes me feel perfectly safe . i could never leave him . i should be utterly helpless by myself .
on my word ! that 's what they believe .
if only we could get away - - you and i . the others are strangers , they mean nothing to me
i 'm so ill , i 'm so exhausted -- i almost don 't care .
some village in the mountains -- alethera , i think .
no , that 's thea 's bed . miss wollsten 's bed is in there .
thea is an orphan .
my last name is pherides .
maybe you 've got the wrong crypt after all it 's twenty years when you wore last here .
if she looked like thea , she must have been beautiful .
don 't . . . george ?
you haven 't got your wings . yeah , that 's right .
why ? don 't they believe in angels ?
there is no george bailey . you have no papers , no cards , no driver 's license , no 4-f card , no insurance policy . . .
oh , i 'm not sure of anything anymore . all i know is this should be bailey park . but where are the houses ?
oh , i forgot . you haven 't got your wings yet . now look , i 'll help you out . concentrate . begin to see something ?
no !
hey , look ! somebody 's driving this cab .
yeah , all right . now , i 'll paste this together .
give the flower a drink .
goodbye , sam .

what 's that got to do with it ? i don 't know you from adam 's off ox . hey , you ! rummy ! come here ! come here !
oh , now , pop , i couldn 't . i couldn 't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office .
harry . . . harry . . .

well , how do you do . congratulations . congratulations . what am i doing ?
george . . .
hello ?
yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
you like it ? i 'll send you a box .
the envious ones say that , george , the suckers . now , i have stated my side very frankly . now , let 's look at your side . young man , twenty-seven , twenty-eight . . . married , making , say . . . forty a week .
what is it a woman , then ? you know , it 's all over town that you 've been giving money to violet bick .
five hundred dollars .
of course you never . only us explorers can get it . i 've been nominated for membership in the national geographic society .
beautiful .
oh , no , don 't . i love that old house .
well , not just one wish . a whole hatful , mary . i know what i 'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that . i 'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and i 'm going to see the world . italy , greece , the parthenon , the colosseum . then i 'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then i 'm going to build things . i 'm gon na build air fields . i 'm gon na build skyscrapers a hundred stories high . i 'm gon na build bridges a mile long . . .
well , then you could swallow it and it 'd all dissolve , see ? and the moonbeams 'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes , and the ends of your hair . am i talking too much ?
i 'm going to scream !
well , i 'll come in for a minute , but i didn 't tell anybody i was coming over here .
thank you .
mary . . .
with butter , if they got any ... .
soon , dark eyes , soon .
but of course .
i 'm supposed to .
sean ! listen ! listen to me , sean .
i think we 're changing course a little .
back down !
i hope that 's the cousin .
i was counting on hours .
lucky . lucky , lucky , lucky .
too hot in the lighthouse ?
shit . shit , shit , shit !
anyone got another set of sails ?
can you get us a line ?
oh , yeah . sure .
could you just keep that crowd back , please ?
you can 't stop me .
goddamnit , hendricks , untie the rope there .
at least you 're safe . what about the others ?
stay here . don 't go anywhere . just stay here .
look -- i just got this from phil fogarty . it was in the camera belonging to the missing divers . it proves i was right , all along .
my boss and your boss . sure .
home it is .
better yet .
mike 's out there .
what ?
what the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls ? jesus , it 's right there in front of you . i know what a goddamn shark looks like , i 've been through it , don 't you understand ? i 've seen this sonofabitch before !
brody ? this is patrol base .
shouldn 't he be at home ?
you stay with mrs. silvera , tootsie . okay ?
sure they did ... .
shh . shhh ... .
great .
great .
maybe .
gaff rigged ? why not a staysail schooner ? go anywhere . look at this -- the mayan , an alden schooner .
3:30 .
huh ?
is there something i don 't know about ?
i 'll be right there . wait up .
name it .
sean , baby , please ... .
yeah . go on , beat it .
have you checked the bars ? the guy 's irresponsible ; he 's done this before .
and a missing man .
it 's easy . put a net on the derrick . put the net in the water by the intake passage . turn off the intake passage . shark comes out into the net and is hauled up .
... me , too .
make this quick !
and here i thought i was charming you .
thanks to you .
how 'd it get in here ? !
the water ski show ! we have to get them out !
the net would have to be secured by the intake passage .
someone 's looking for you .
well , wait till you see the rest .
come on ! check this out !
and alone .
no . of course not . don 't listen to him . he 's - he 's ... ... my brother .
what , hon ?
balance , kelly . bal-lance !
ohhhhh shhhhiiiit .
hey .
aww , can 't i keep it ?
kind of dull in there for you , isn 't it ? why don 't you throw in another shark ?
that 's impossible . if it 's that big , why hasn 't anybody seen it ? huh ? tell me that . it 's like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool .
it 's large enough ...
you could also try a bamboo pole and a worm .
right , mike .
all right , hit those lights too .
watch me , grandma ... .
was uncle sean ever bad ? did you ever spank him ?
my tea set . i got my tea set . thank you ... .
please , mom . at least consider it . you should get away . you shouldn 't be alone now ... .
my mother always told me , if god had intended us to ride parachutes for fun , we 'd have been born with free tickets ... .
it sure is ... .
tell matt he should be here ... .
because ... .
i don 't know ... you ... i don 't know .
but it went away ... we would have known ... .
i 'm sorry . please , carla . i didn 't think there was any danger . i 'm sorry . i love you . both of you .
i 'm not on vacation ... .
i 'd be afraid of losing ... .
do you enjoy dealing blackjack ?
it 's beginning ... .
you have something to say about everything ... .
what difference does it make ? it 's here ... .
we 'll divert it ... we 'll do something ... .
he knows what he has to do ... .
hello ? thea who ? i know it 's thea brody . how many grandchildren do i have ? i know you can use the phone by yourself . you 're a big girl . i know you 're five .
it 's too dangerous ... .

good night , daddy ... .
i 'll miss you ... .
i won 't have anyone in my family any- where near the water ... . never again ... never ... .

once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window ... .
i am .
there 's a lot ... i want to talk about it ... .
i 'm going to finish what jake and i started . i owe him that . hell , i owe him everything ... . i 'll get something important done for both of us ... .

a shark attacked thea and some kids ... she 's going after it ... .
she said it was coming ... .
get her started ... .
they spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it they don 't care what it is ... .
the world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers .
i fly elephants for smugglers ... .
any faster and it 'll turn into a flying cuisinart and dice us into oblivion ... .
it needs more time to charge .
you don 't have to say anything , matt ... i know how you feel ... .
where the hell 's the beer ... ?
you 're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics . you 're never going to amount to anything .
holy shit !
gave them the day off ... .
so did i ... .
you don 't know shit about anything . time you learned ... .
lots of times ... .
you think he 's not good enough for her ? you 're right . if she was my mother , i 'd send her home right now .
close ... i don 't know ... just get the hell ... .
my equipment doesn 't crap out ... .
in a few minutes ... .
anything to do before i go home ?
it 's a method for quitting smoking .
to throw out of the window .
i was wrong .
what does it matter what i bel- ieve ? .. what you got ta worry about is what citrine believes ..
car accident .
no god , brother . if there was a god , asses wouldn 't be at the perfect height for kicking .
no .. you didn 't know that ..
don 't thank me . thank margie .
i spose i 'm drinking myself to sleep . it 's helena 's christmas songs .. they 're really pretty ..
hey ..
that , i couldn 't tell you .. and don 't worry about anya this crap , by the time you 're back it 's gone ..
yeah , that 's all very inter- esting , but where 's the body ?
cut your own throat , you 're ner- vous about it , tend to hesitate . he 's got three trial cuts , lower left side of the neck , before he works up courage for the big one .
well , her , it ain 't . that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat .

well , that 's who she is . cept she can 't run away .
no one 's gon na make that gent . six months investigation , & the nearest we got , we thought he was a sailor .

i 'm already walking . where is it ?
his father 's the manager , sir . the kid was up there shooting vermin , and he found the body .

mission ... statement ...
plus , you could use that commission .
bye you guys . _ 88 .
good night .
sometimes i can 't tell at all , what 's going through that head of yours .
oh , knock it off ! _ 89 .
no --
oh , well , why didn 't you say so ? and oh , i don 't know if you 're interested in this detail , but i was just about to tell you that i love him . i love him , and i don 't care what you think . i love him for the guy he wants to be , and i love him for the guy he almost is . i love him .
congratulations . you 're still my agent .
i 'm not about love -- i 'm about `` showing you the money . ''
very much .
why not ?
you .
no , i 'm saying to be --
fine .
good deal , man .

no .
hey , that 's my word , okay ?
jerry , rod is very very upset . tyson , no !
i know you say to take the arizona offer , but my husband needs more recognition . _ 25 .
and say what ? `` please remove your dick from my ass ? ! ''
what are you talking about -- `` don 't get emotional . '' if you ask me , you haven 't gotten emotional enough about this man . _ 98 .
the best commercial director in the business . i hail you .
i know . it sucks . i suck .
a lot . we got a big fax today ... we need this commission , buddy .
right up ahead , buddy --
that 's why they cheer , you know . the white man sending the black man into battle ...
a few of us survived . a lot more died . and we were better prepared and better armed . how many days have they been missing ?
this is how you play god .
one way to find out .
i filmed this the morning they left .
never had a doubt . never did . us kirby men , we stick around , huh ?
we 're not going anywhere , i promise .
i 'm trying ! that thing took him down this way !
i would completely support that .
who 's that ?
here !
he 's not a kill , he 's still alive .
where is it ?
the bones will be there when we get back . that 's the nice thing about them . they never run away . and besides , you got me into this . i don 't intend to be alone with these people .
mr. and mrs. kirby ! if you look out the right you can see ...
some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions . you rushed in with no thought to the consequences , to yourself or anyone else . you 're no better than the people who built this place .
really ? what do you do there ?
any weapons , radios ?
it 's a wonder you aren 't . i 'm amazed , eric . i barely lasted 30 hours . you lasted eight weeks .
the important thing is we both made it . that 's something we have in common .
she 's the one person i could always count on . and she 's saved me more times than she realizes . i owe her everything .
the population will stabilize eventually . they 'll adapt to fit different roles .
there is . i own a place called kirby paint and title plus . we 're out in the westgate shopping center in enid , oklahoma . the `` plus '' is for bathroom fixtures , fireplaces accessories , patio furniture . stuff like that .
if the nest is upwind , so are we . when he comes back , he 'll know we 're here before we have a chance . the truck --
because i didn 't know ! i don 't have the faintest idea what they 're doing here .
ian , you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world . i can 't walk so far and leave no footprints ; die and leave nothing with my name on it . i will not be known only for my failures . and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic . you 're too smart . you'e too proud . dr. malcolm . please . this is a chance at redemption . for both of us . there 's no time to equivocate , we must seize it now , before --
-humidity , i know . highest lead density on the market .
is that who we 're really working for ? ! gene splicers ? !
you got ta be kidding . you dragged me out of greenpeace to be a corporate stooge ? you couldn 't get anybody else ?
everyone , keep your voices down !
dr. malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology .
exactly what john hammond wanted us to do .
to collect my fee .
isn 't it obvious ?
operations building . far end of the street .
possible .
it 's just fed . it won 't attack unless it 's threatened . don 't move .
let it go , peter . the animal won .
piss .
you can 't stay , kelly , that 's it . it 's too dangerous .
dr. juttson , please take kelly back to camp right away . leave the other car for us and we 'll meet you there in an hour or so .
now 's the perfect time . the animal just fed , so it won 't stalk us for food . predators don 't hurt when they 're not hungry .
ian , if we recall the boat now , we 've made two invasive landings in one day . that 'll have to go in any paper i write , and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated . you know the academic world as well as i do , once they smell blood in the water , you 're dead . our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic . that means if we bend a blade of grass , we bend it right back the way it-
you go if you like , but we 're not waiting for you . move it out ! !
runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait .
stop the program ! stop the program !
yeah , again , in theory , but - -
dodgson , dodgson . we got dodgson here ! see , nobody cares . nice hat . what are you trying to look like , a secret agent ?
uh - - anybody else think we shouldn 't be out here ?
anybody at all . feel free to speak up .
oh , you know , if it 's alright , i 'd like to stay with dr. harding and finish with the trike . is that okay ?
come along . i know my way around a kitchen . come along .
we 're - - still perfecting a viewing system . the raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting .
they 'll all be fine . who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert ?
control ? ! you never had control ! i was overwhelmed by the power of this place . so i made a mistake too . i didn 't have enough respect for that power , and it 's out now . you 're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces . john , there 's nothing worth picking up . the only thing that matters now are the people we love . alan , lex , and tim . and john , they 're out there where people are dying - - people are dying , you know ?
that 's good . that 's right ! they died around a dried-up puddle ! without fighting each other . this is looking good .
what kind of park is it ?
can 't we see the unfertilized host eggs ? !
what 's that ?
we 'll discuss sexism in survival situations when i get back . you just take me through this step by step . i 'm on channel two .
stick to my heels .
the shutdown must have turned off all the fences . goddamn it ! even nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence .
juanito , if they pull the funding , that will really slow things down . if they pull the funding that 's going to slow things down around here .
no , we don 't have any animatronics here . these are the real miracle workers of jurassic park .
relax donald , relax . they 're scientists . they ought to be curious .
really ?
it 's so strong ! look at its nose . need help ?
tim , you 're gon na have to let go . i 'm going to count to three .
tim , i 'm right here . easy catch . easy catch . count to three..
try to !
when you got ta go , you got ta go .
the brachiosaur ? thirty .
wu ?
who ?
after careful consideration , dr. grant - - so have i .
i 'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain , you know !
no , i didn 't hear anything . no , we 're okay .
timmy ! the power is coming down , quick !
wait a minute ? what do you mean `` worked '' ? everything is still off !
turn it off , lex ! turn it off !
what if we fall ? i hate trees .
i 'm afraid i am gon na fall !
shut up ! you 're scaring me . stop ! you 're scaring me .
great .
you learn something new every day . let 's go .
i think it 's our best bet . they 're taking apart his house right now ... they found weapons , blood , a mountain of evidence . we can 't say he was framed .
i don 't know if anything 's going to work in this case . therefore , we have to try everything .
we 're going to need at least two full rem cycles to get a clear neurological profile . three hours minimum , six hours ideal .
let 's split up . you take the left side , i 'll take the right . we 'll meet in front of the cineplex .
my client ... is dead . but i think he 's a free man .
even the so-called new town isn 't so new . only the people . people of the future living in buildings of the past . has anyone seen eduard ?
you have been hearing the sordid side then .
you were his friend . one link is all they need .
the formality of a trial would be too costly for them . they 're beginning to understand that it 's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support .
yes .
sit down , kafka .
excuse me , i have to copy this for central docketing by 2:30 .
yes .
two or three months , that 's all . -- i seduced him .
you won 't have any trouble finding it .
they 're ubiquitous . what we try to do ... is make them a little less so .
he was murdered .
you mean because it 's been a while since there was a sunny day ? what a good detective you are .
you mean you 've actually begun some ?
that 's obvious , isn 't it ? we have an opening for a new member .
then why haven 't i been --
lying in the gutter where they belong .
she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing .
and we 're upset too .
now ann ...
now now , ann ! try be to polite .
sun 's coming up ... we 've been in the fog for six hours .
leave it , ann .
that 's too bad .
) they are now .
yeah ? ... well , i gave 'em a taste of american lead ... and i don 't see 'em coming back for seconds !
forget it , denham ... for godssake
she 's got a bit of an attitude , that girl . she 's turned down a bunch of money . too bad ... it would 've been a great angle - `` beauty and the beast '' . i must be getting old - i thought you two had something going there .
yeah .
please --
will you let me go then ?
isn 't that sweet . well it could be any one of them bubi ; i get to see them all .
ok .
i don 't want you to look up . there 's someone on the skylight .
you said you wanted these .
oh don 't be all hypocrite . or do you really like other kicks ? is it more just having power over someone ? -- so you don 't really need to --
when ?
yup .
drop it .
trask said i should move . let 's not make a thing of it .
i believed her , pete .
unknown , unidentified and unwanted . and there 's more every day man , there 's more everyday .
i looked it up .
trask --
detroit .
i guess ...
oh , for god 's sake ... here .
tough shit . you 're stuck with me .
see you in the morning light ...
sure .
sure .
boy , i bet you if mommy ever saw this she 'd remarried you .
no , son , i didn 't get fired . i 'll tell you what we 'll do , okay ? how about if we go to a burger king and then we watch a little t.v . and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow . just you and me ... how 'bout that ?
sustained .
no questions .
your honor , i 'm only examining the man 's employment record . he pretends to fitness when he can not hold a job .
so do you .
kramer ...
do you want the kid or don 't you ?
no cried ?
it depends on the quality . and , that it be indian .
all ?
the united nations voted not to hear our appeal .
yes , but they say he did .
far , far away .
answer .
please .
look here !
you are the man who wrote this letter . you are the man who has come back to lead us . you will soon have great responsibilities . you must know what to do .
i shall send a letter to america , to the president , informing him of our problem .
eight thousand , five hundred , soldiers and officers . we have recently requested mortars , anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from india . we have several hundred in the area .
and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking . agreed . send ngabo . is that all ?
the khamba 's gun is his most prized possession . i admire them so . they face a modern , well equipped army , and still , they fight .
the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent . they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham . it has been destroyed . women and children , trying to escape from the fighting , have been shot with machine guns , fired from airplanes .
non-violence means co-operation when it is possible . resistance , when it is not .
soft . nice . i have a good friend back in lhasa .
ahh .
reting rinpoche has been arrested . he tried to overthrow regent taktra . today , he is brought back to lhasa by government officials . the monks at sera monastery have been on his side . now , there is trouble between them and the army .
i need to see his habitat .
i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless .
i have no interest in ever looking at you , hector . could you please cut me down ?
obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet .
'cause he just ate a cow , you stupid --
we both know what they 'll do .
that 's actually the easy part .
you do ?
we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs .
i 'd be able to see something .
i 'm sorry but you 're ...
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow , look for prints .
what ? why ... people have been killed , i hardly think i 'm having a good time , why would ... does it show ?
back us in a little , we need to get a shot !
i don 't care . hank . end it .
yeah .
but we do . hey , we 'll always have maine .
likewise .
let 's go .
obviously i was wrong !
where is he ? !
don 't count on it . we better take him out .
it 's just that --
i asked you to be nice to him .
look .
absolutely .
me too .
you work for me . i 'm not comfortable with -- y'know , `` us '' ...
thanks , ardelia .
i think we may be , yes .
well , she 's not local . her ears are pierced three times each , and she 's wearing green glitter nail polish . looks like town to me ...
johns hopkins finally came up with a name for us . we fed him into known offenders , and he came up cherries . subject 's name is `` jamie gumb , '' aka `` john grant . '' lecter 's description was accurate , he just lied about the name .
no fair ! you lured him with produce .
officer starling . welcome back .
the latin name comes from two rivers in hell . your man - he drops these girls into rivers , every time . didn 't i read that ?
why , i am looking at you , miss .
i have nothing to go back for .
munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests .
what are they doing to duncan ? duncan !
do not let gratitude get in the way ...
do you hear me , sir ! if you ever fall ... into british hands ... what white water ?
your enemy ...
tradin ' your skins in castleton ?
you 're not coming with us ?
what else ?
... not enough time to get to albany and back with reinforcements ...
it was a war party . it means they 're on the attack up and down the frontier .
that 's all , sir .
sir . webb has no idea . and he certainly does not know to send reinforcements !
terrible feature of war in the americas . best to keep your sight fixed on our duty .
and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon england 's policies in her own colonies ? to come and go without so much as a `` by your leave . ''
fire ! ! !
yes sir !
fire !
when the grey hair is dead , magua will eat his heart . before he dies magua will put his children under the knife so the grey hair will see his seed is wiped out forever .
and this ?
be my guest .
intelligence may not be the right word ...
what ? ...
there 's now a problem with the weather for pickup . there 's a typhoon in our sector ... ... we 're going to be delayed twelve hours ...
i got hung up ! try this !
roger ... more light , sixpack ...
you screw around like that again and --
after a month of it you 'd think i 'd be used to it .
well , i always heard you don 't `` learn '' leadership , you earn it . how did you know they 'd get into the vodka ?
the escape bubbles ?
i can 't see them !
mr. beck , the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of -- -
jones ... come with me . cobb , you and doc check the rooms .
roger .
ahhhh !
let 's get it out of here and bring in a new one .
sounds like a good week , beck . in fact ... i put your folder in front of the vice president of district operations last night ...
beautiful .
i signed-up for the stock option .
you 're damn right i do . five years down here and i 'll pull in more than 15 topside . i 'm not down here for the fun , i 'll tell you that .
fuck the suits , it 's the people monitoring them . it doc had been there like he 's supposed to it never would 've happened !
it wouldn 't make any difference in there ... he could be two feet away and on fire and she 'd still not see him !
aw , loosen up , bowman ... hey , willie , i got one served up for you .
shhhh ... don 't tell no one . job security .
what music ? there ain 't no music .
pretty good . he sent them out videotaping outcrop .
fuck double pay , man ! i want out of here !
i ain 't , goddamnit ... it 's jones ! ..
i feel it , too ... someone 's trying to get out .
like a leech .
i ought to smack your face !
oh man , that 's just great ...
don 't fuckin ' worry , i ain 't .
sorry , darling ... just thought a little humor would loosen us all up ... you know ? ...
seven hundred for the pair .
i am not sure what 's more worrying , the job or your past .
the baptist got his name from drowning people for hatchet .
and nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to ; a bit anti-social , you know .
they can 't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked , can they ?
let 's have a butcher 's . jesus , there 's lots of everything . we 've got god knows how much of this stinking weed ; we 've got a shit load of cash ; and we 've got a . . . traffic warden .
don 't play innocent with me bazza ; spanking !
jesus christ !
try that one .
all right , kenny .
it just cost me fifty quid to have this done . if you think i am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you 're mistaken , kenny .
there is no such thing as easy in my experience and , if you think this is going to be easy , you 're a dick . it may be easier than most but it 's not going to be easy .
i didn 't touch him , he just passed out .
who are you going to kill plank ? there 's no one there .
ok , open the gate .
how about you ? all right ?
all right , all fucking right , i am coming . willie , he doesn 't know you are here , just sort something out , ok .
well that depends on how you look at it . i can afford it as long as i see it again , if that 's what you mean . you got the rest from the fat man and bacon ?
hit the fuckers .
it 's either that , my old boy 's place , and we lose a digit daily . i am going to call him .
listen , if he has the guns he might have the money . . . i think we should go and see him .
i don 't know , but what i do know is that there 's no more harry , which means there 's no more debt , and if there 's no more debt there 's no more problem , and there 's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead . i think , if i get this right , we haven 't done anything wrong anyway , which means we are in the clear .
tom , go and throw those guns off a bridge .
bacon , the fat man and myself , and it 's time to make a call to harry .
top of the list of priorities , how nice they look .
he said he thinks we have paid him , and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now .
yes . . . and is there something else you want to say ? eddy
well , you 're going to have a problem carrying on , aintcha .
of course you are . all right , ed .
nick the greek .
when the bottle in my arse has contracted i 'll let you know .
you 'll find out when i get you home . thanks , sam .
from back in houston . we both come up on fifth street .
he 'll live .
i know that , sergeant . we were just dancing . there was a bunch of us there . shadow just come down looking for trouble .
who said anything about shootin ' anybody ?
dad --
lead mine .
he can 't hear with that rig on -- mikey !
we had a kid pass out in the men 's room . the town isn 't much .
you get the feeling he doesn 't want to be here ?
he 'll probably be getting a medical discharge --
nice to meet you , ma'am .
aqui ! venga por aqui ! [ over here ! come this way ! ]
they need help . jaime , anselma -- esta es mi jefa --
he was a unique individual .
that 's not the whole story . the mexicans that know , that remember , understand what buddy was for their people . hell , it was mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him .
rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue --
we need a drug rehab program , we need a new elementary school --
oh , you know , the usual troublemakers . danny padilla from the sentinel , that crowd .
it wouldn 't happen to be your construction company gon na get the bid on building this thing , would it , h.l . and jorge , you wouldn 't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters --
look , i 'm not gon na campaign against your deal here , but if anybody asks me , i got to tell them the truth . we -- don 't -- need -- a new jail .
and that was the last time you saw him ?
well , it 's a complicated issue --
nope .
that would have kept you out of the magic circle . which was presumably the idea . these are about nix .
deep shit ?
i know him . i saw him .
he won 't .
i swear ... this is the place swann told me about . the rocks ...
it was me .
pimm 's dead . jennifer desiderio 's disappeared ...
sure .
no word from d'amour ?
fuck you .
why don 't you leave this alone ? let everybody think it 's over ?
you don 't get in without one . it 's like a gentlemen 's club for illusionists . except most of us aren 't gentlemen .
it 's not a business . harry . it 's a vocation .
in my time , and nobody else 's .
who 's not ?
you want to be like that , swann ? mud and shit ?
binding you .
who do i have to fuck to get off this planet ?
i know , it 's stupid .
no .
hi , charlie .

yes , no .
bye .
that 's ok , you 'll figure it out .

sure .
it 's probably trivial .
no . of course not . mmmm . anago . my favorite .
when did they find her ?
i don 't know . in a way , i 'm glad it all happened .
so you 're going to kill her ? put the gun down claire .
yes . it 's exactly ...
i 'm gon na go make a stink . sit tight . i 'll make sure you get a change of clothes .
of course not . they put him through severe mental stress . causing this aneurysm .
i hope so .
you ready ?
i know , maya , but you 'll understand when you see this man . i really need your strength .
just open the door , please .
miette , come here and relax .
... art sank , sun set , ark sank again ...
kelson , hold on a second ...
oh , thank you , thank you so much !
i cranked it all the way up . nothing but hum .
townsend believed , just as god became man in christ . so satan will assume human form . i believe it too .
the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out .
i 'm going to look around .
what ?
your 33rd birthday . the transformation will be a perversion of christ 's rising from the dead . townsend discovered it in one of lareaux 's books .
that can 't be right . my birthday 's tomorrow .
i was desperate . i knew you wrote about murders . i needed a way in .
and his message was `` together , no matter what ? ''
not a lot .
you are the younger of two ...
suit yourself . but does this mean anything to you ?
we millionaires yet ?
of course .
he 's looking right at me .
sure . in between all the other things i have to do .
what 'd you do ?
it was the least we could do . and i love to cook .
oh , sorry .
yes , we appreciate that .
four days .
hey . you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight . let me worry about your date .
she hates all freshmen .
you mean my championship trophy ? my bad .
sometimes . but what 's the alternative , not playing ? you remember big toni ? she quit last year , now she 's working at some bookstore . i mean , look at us . they treat us like we 're hollywood stars over here . we just played in the championship game . it doesn 't get much sweeter than this .
i was about to ask you the same thing , going out with a college boy and all .
quit .
right here .
you think for once we could talk about something besides basketball ?
uh huh .
i was . i see your peach fuzz finally grew in .
thanks .
find .
no , you said i should get my degree . i like my `` bullshit '' job , okay , and it 's gon na lead to a spot in the front office . til then , don 't worry , there 's just enough savings to keep your ass in gucci and gold .
keep your voice down .
happy . and he won 't want to see you .
these adults are tough enough , i think you 'll be surprised -- the mexican 's a bit of a question mark --
it 's me . claudia . it 's me .
no . no .
get the fuck out of here .
it 's the lapd , can you open the door , please ?
it 's fine .
okey-doke .
if he hadn 't pissed his pants , we woulda won . we fucking had this game .
fine . phil , you still there ?
maybe i 'm just happy to see my friend , brad there .
don 't do this , don .
like i said , yeah --
-- fuck you .
well i guess the question is this : do you remember miss simms ?
that 's not mine .
jean baptiste poquelin moliere .
i was saying ... thinking maybe i 'd get my own quiz show someday , jimmy . just like you !
it 's okay , stanley . it 's alright .
i don 't know .
i'ii go ... .is it ... back here ?
not as much as i used to . ever since we started , i haven 't really gone in to school that much because i 've been getting more and more auditions --
no they don 't --
i don 't wan na do it . why can 't one of you do it --
shut the fuck up .
... i don 't ... .
maybe .
i got ta go to the bathroom .
shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about ?
m'lady ... ?
we have much to discuss . tomorrow .
well here is the problem at hand : the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits , and kill him . as our english rivals have left the catholic church , louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both . he has already picked the pope . only the jesuits , who put god above throne or papacy , stand in his way .
replace the king .
i am with you !
hold your goblet with two fingers .
i know . god go with you .
can 't you see i 'm praying , goddammit ? !
hell may be our destination , dear porthos , but not this trip .
i expected action . there was no killing , no fighting , i was useless .
i will answer all your questions . but first soap , water , and a razor .
come on ...
then let him kill me , if all my faith is wrong .
we will make our own luck tonight ... if phillippe holds up .
he is right , d'artagnan .
she died giving you to me . and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves .
raoul --
i came to see you safely out . check for yourself .
i will sit with you . i can 't sleep either .
she will be at the ball .
if i could have a blade , then i would be please to run with you .
phillippe . rest now .
it ... was nothing . a nightmare , nothing more . go away , i --
my twin . which has kept him alive . until now .
not by you . i will order d'artagnan to do it .
the corridor nullifies our number ... and no one has stomach to fight the captain .
i did not want to upset you . it was tragic . i did everything i could for him . i ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety , far from the fighting . but he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger .
yeah , stick around , you might learn something .
we 've got kidnapping , grand theft auto , burglary , and two counts of murder on you , and i 'm gon na see to it personally that it sticks !
we 're all gon na fan out ! c'mon , let 's do a sweep of the alleys -
don 't worry -
fine -
that 's got to our secret agent man ! do we have an address ?
well it 's just kind of a coincidence , isn 't it ? stanton and fleming , both started in '83 , both in area six ... both in vice ?
could explain why fleming was there .
no ...
this is tubbs . sorry i can 't answer the phone , i 'm out square dancing . leave a message --
shit , what i have now made our setup in angola look like tinker toys . i 've been skipping through internal revenue records all day . i even have video strip poker . you want to check it out ?
ok ... where do you want to start ?
i 'm going to need a way to get there .
don 't worry about me ... ... and don 't forget your helmet . you don 't want to get a ticket .
screw him !
not with this ...
if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor , he 'll come for me . so we 're going to set me up as bait to draw him out . give him a clean shot . that 's what you were thinking , isn 't it ?
i need to talk to you about will graham .
i 'll come back later . i got messages at the holiday inn to collect .
to recover the mind set .
i want a chopper on the roof in three minutes . to meigs field . at meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the gulf stream .
they got shot a telex . they 're on if now ...
they had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract .
uh-huh .
it 's a surprise .
i made you a gin and tonic . it 's by the side of the sofa ...
i 'm fine , francis .
francis did a thing for you today so i couldn 't have you . and he was wrong . i am the dragon ! give me your hand .
i want her ! i want her alive ... i 'm going to keep her ! you hear me ! ! !
'i have had a great privilege . i have seen with wonder the strength of the red dragon . all i wrote about him before was lies from will graham . he made me write them . now i understand . 'will graham : you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread . because i was forced to lie , he will be more merciful to me than to you . 'i will be a testament to the truth , now . about his work . about his becoming . '
uh ... sure ...
it 's written on toilet tissue . 'my dear dr. lecktor , i wanted to tell you i 'm delighted that you 've taken an interest in me . i know that you alone can understand what i 'm becoming . 'i know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things , understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what i am becoming . just as the source of light is burning . mr. graham , there 's a hole torn and punched out , then it says ... 'i have a complete collection of your press notices . i think of them as unfair . as unfair as mine . the `` tooth fairy . '' what could be more inappropriate . investigator graham interests me . very purposeful looking . i hope we can correspond . there 's another piece missing here . i 'll read the bottom part . 'after i hear back from you , i might send you something wet . signed : avid fan . it has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom .
i love you ...
you didn 't do it to me , will ; it 's happened to us . and if i survive the wallpaper we 'll be okay ... he 's after you now , isn 't he ?
yeah . that 's great . a little time . i tell you what , buckaroo ... see you around .
you got a deal ...
i keep getting it for christmas .
it 's a veddy small island in de caspian sea . it sunk . george oh . hm . i 'm uh , sorry . well , look , i 'm probably out of my mind -- but i think you 're very interesting . if you ever need representation ... we should talk .
okay ... i 'll go back . but just let them know , first they ain 't gettin ' latka . they 're gettin ' tony !
i don 't know ! andy ... you need to look inside : who are you trying to entertain ? the audience ... or yourself ?
you 're blind ! there is no envelope anymore ! ! it hurts me to say this ... but there 's only one solution -- i don 't want you two to ever work together again .
andy ... it 's me . i 've got some crummy news . taxi 's been canceled .
of course ! but that doesn 't mean i don 't need everyone 's support ! i can 't be surrounded by negative energy .
you 've got good days and bad days .
nah , it 's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing . it didn 't hurt at all . it was just a yoga move . i tucked my head in .
nah , it 's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing . it didn 't hurt at all . it was just a yoga move . i tucked my head in .

hey , i love movie theater popcorn ... but that doesn 't mean i have to sit through `` on golden pond . ''
hey , i love movie theater popcorn ... but that doesn 't mean i have to sit through `` on golden pond . ''

i used to think you were original .
what are ya talkin ' about ? ! i was the one saying i didn 't believe it !
yeah . they don 't know whether to be sad , or angry .
he said he 's coming back !
they 're gon na lynch him !
why isn 't he moving ? ?
it 's already begun .
we have no choice but to continue as planned . deploy the sentinels . immediately .
no , lieutenant , your men are already dead .
no way . not possible .
i don 't know ... my computer ...
i know but i felt like taking a shift .
yeah , 'course i 'm sure .
that 's what you think . they 've promised to back me , trinity . they 're going to reinsert my body . i 'll go back to sleep and when i wake up , i 'll be fat and rich and i won 't remember a goddamn thing . it 's the american dream .
he 's going to pop !
have to . the image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there 's way too much information to decode the matrix . you get used to it , though . your brain does the translating . i don 't even see the code . all i see is blonde , brunette , and redhead . you want a drink ?
what if he isn 't the one , morpheus ? how can you be so sure ?
i know , trinity . don 't worry . he 's going to make it .
how do you know all this ?
there 's a small ledge . it 's a short climb . you can make it .
there are only two ways out of this building . one is that scaffold . the other is in their custody . you take a chance either way . i leave it to you .
wild , isn 't it ?
i didn 't say that it would be easy , neo . i just said that it would be the truth .
show me .
i 'm trying to free your mind , neo , but all i can do is show you the door . you 're the one that has to step through . tank , load the jump program .
because ... i didn 't think i would ?
your mind makes it real .
the body can not live without the mind .
no , neo . i 'm trying to tell you that when you 're ready , you won 't have to .
no . i did not . i have never told anyone this , neo . after i saw the oracle i thought ... no , i misunderstood what she told me . i believed that it was all about me . that i would find the one , not that he would find me .
trinity ! go ! get to the basement . find the catch basin !
she told you exactly what you needed to hear . that 's all . sooner or later , neo , you 're going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path .
good .
do it !
honestly ? i don 't know .
no . it 's safe here and i don 't have much time .
... shit .
easy , neo . easy .
what choice ?
yeah ?
guns . lots of guns .
he 's alive .
hurry , neo .
thanks .
let go of her .
yeah , well , keep away from those chinx . they don 't have shit .
you sure ?
all right ! quiet ! for $ 40 i could give you ...
well , my stuff comes from maryland ... you know what that means ?
'dost thou say this of thyself , or have others told thee of me ? '
i don 't know , but god help him if he does it again !
all right , forget it . tony , you got anything we can put on his face ?
should i slap him ?
listen ... i 'm a guest here .
cut it out stupid . it 's me .
stupid bastard ... you get your cousin half-sick over this .
did you see them run !
what you 're doing for me isn 't worth it ... believe me !
no you 're not ...
i 'll be here . don 't worry .
good idea .
for these prices don 't be particular . that 's all they had - but next week we 'll see ...
ok , get in .
he 'll be here . look , take this for now .
we 'll be here .
fine .
yes , you did .
what i don 't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you 're gon na read anyway .
yeah . that 's what i said , sick in the head .
oh yeah , that 's a possibility .
charlie , couple of courses isn 't enough to get you student deferred ... i mean if they wanted to draft you , you would 've been drafted by now .
oh , that 's ok ... i 've been in and out of this place fifty times .
here .
uhuh ... probably a good idea . why don 't you do it this time ?
for god 's sakes ... i told you before ... nothing . charlie , i can 't stay in here too long at this hour ... will you please listen to me ?
i feel fine -- nothing wrong with me .
of course ! a double for michael , tony .
quiet please .
drew called from the astar , they 're still two minutes away .
you think so ?
yeah , bill , the suspense is killing me .
well , maybe next time joe goes , he 'll take us along .
a name ?
we 've got some things to discuss .
yes , it is .
i would say , sir , it is right up there with jif and skippy . but miles ahead of peter pan . like a taste ?
what 'business ' ?
-- and now you 're going to pee some more .
oh , excuse me . this is -- uh -- this is --
certainly . goodnight .
i don 't think so . do you ?
but who is he ? what are his creden- tials ? what is his relationship to you ?
no lawyers , drew . we 're going to offer you a deal .
joe , you do get around .
yeah . neat .
you 're on , quin-cee . destination hospital . joe , you 'll be the tour guide . okay ? how 's that sound to you ?
that we did . thanks to you . he was wobbling , mind you , but you spplied the coup de grace .
as long as it takes .
it 's so very nice to see you again .
no problem . i 'll leave you two alone . i can tell you guys have something on the fire --
what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish ? i told drew and the board that bill depended on you . drew led me on , but i had no business telling him in the first place . he was setting up bill from day one . drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts . bontecou was outside , drew was mr . inside . and i was the fool who made it all happen . oh god , what do i do ?
because that 's the kind of man bill parrish is .
no .
yes .
not now .
be sorry for nothing .
i don 't like the way drew spoken to you . but i feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back .
thank you .
yes .
oh . okay .
no thank you , bill . i can manage .
it 's all yours .
this part i 'm interested in .
bill , i am eating dinner with you . and your family . and that 's what we 're doing . it 's not open for discussion . nothing is . don 't you understand ?
what ?
joe , you don 't know how glad i am you 're aboard . anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man , i 'm in his corner .
sure .
... then don 't .
i am . with you .
i know it 's none of my business --
nothing . i 'm sorry .
nothing .
incidentally , 'joe ' what ?
will it ? ...
i 'm sorry .
oh , yes --
oh , dad , you 're not old . you 'll never be old .
-- this is my lucky day . i arrive in this big bad city and i not only find a doctor , a beautiful woman as well .
you never know . lightning could strike .
but we 've got time .
i 've got to get back for the evening shift , so make yourself at home , watch t.v. , whatever . just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed . i never need them all anyway .
just two . so far . *
yeah ?
don 't be too hard on yourself .
you told me .
who is he ? what have you got me into ?
just relax .
i can talk about whoever the fuck i want ! you won 't even remember what i say ! i can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends !
about your whore of a wife ?
why not ?
* john g. was clever . he took the dead man 's gun and replaced it with the sap that he 'd hit me with . he left my gun and left the getaway car . he gave the police a complete package . they found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man 's hand , and they only found my gun . they didn 't need to look for anyone else . i was the only guy who disagreed with the facts , and i had brain damage . *
thank you .
you have no idea where you 've just come from ? what you 've just done ?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds , and tell me if you really think that sammy is faking his condition .
i guess i 've told you about my condition .
probably left it in your room .
she 's involved with these drug dealers .
the jaguar 's out front . you didn 't even bother to put it around back .
well , i hope it 's not as serious as his , 'cos this guy 's dead .
that , and your thing . *
just some guy . does it even matter who ? i stopped asking myself why a long time ago . no reason , no conspiracy ; just bad fucking luck . a couple of junkies , too * strung out to realize that your wife didn 't live alone . when you killed him , * i 've never seen you so happy - i was convinced you 'd remember . but it didn 't stick , like nothing ever sticks . like this won 't stick .

well , we 're veering into classified info here , but i 'll tell you that it involved a donor . he was dead of course , so it 's not like anything unethical was happening .
well , technically `` yes '' , but this is only the prototype .
sure .
yeah , who isn 't .
it 's the game 's logic core . we actually patterned it after human brainwaves . i mean , there 's a personality in there . that 's what makes it so incredible .
funny .
greg never came home . a few hours is one thing , nick , but this is different . something 's happened to him .

his name is jeffrey pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 ford pickup , black with red interior . please ?
hello , i 'm gon na need this right now ... this guy ... well we think he might be going after the governor . twenty minutes ? fine .
dad , i 'm trying . the chairs , they won 't scrunch .
honey , ahh , guys don 't wan na appear over anxious , so if you think there 's a boy that might like you , let him know that you like him , so he won 't feel he 's taking such a risk when he 's thinking of asking you out .
vada i wan na ask you a favor , remember you can absolutely say no if you want to .
look we react to every kick this baby gives , maybe vada 's trying to tell us something too .
listen , if a boy wants to do homework with you , it really means he didn 't have nerve to ask you out on a date , so you 'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying , and the next thing you know you 're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars .
i was pushing as fast as i could .
maggie muldovan ? did you ... know her ?
i 'm sorry , it 's just ... i 've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and ... sometimes it gets out of hand .
you mean , you knew about me ?
i 'd like to , thanks .
does she ?
neither can mine . she 's dead . it 's shelly who 's pregnant .
well actually i was born in siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my dad .
it 's no problem , i had a mother once myself .
are you jeffrey pommeroy ?
you 're so clever .
umm , i 'm trying to find out her greatest achievement .
who are you ? hitler 's hall monitor ?
may i use the phone please .
he is one of the great poets .
at least it gives you plenty of exercise .
owh ...
oh no ? ! ? ! ? !
he 's an undertaker .
was rose .
vada , i know that traditionally you 're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you 're officially married ... but these are very , very special circumstances .
don 't worry , i 'll do it in my own subtle way .
i don 't know , he 's got an awful lot on his mind right now .
sounds like you 're very organized .
anyone with taste , anyone with breeding ... . a gentleman , would choose british racing green , with maybe a tan interior ... but when you buy a red car , with a black interior and wire wheels , you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and i 'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is ... in front of the children .
is that a yes ?
did she mention any contests that she won ? i mean she must have had some awards , she was so talented and all .
leave him alone ! come on , let 's go .
no . just , more activity .
i haven 't had a bingo partner in ages .
in ages , i know , me neither .
i 'll second that .
look , you 're not gon na take shelly 's camper .
is it really your camper ?
you can get the general idea ...
ya , that rack holds six ties .
last month you wanted to play the violin . then you wanted to be a ventriloquist .
ahh , vada , just put anything you want in the cart , anything at all . i don 't know what 's gotten into her today .
not acknowledging harry 's comment you 'll be okay little fish .
i 'll ride on the bumper cars with you !
get away , get away ! !
i 'm not upset . i will never play with those girls . i only surround myself with people who i find intellectually stimulating .
it 's a mood ring , it tells what mood i 'm in .
i don 't think so . shelly , how can i get thirty five dollars ?
aarrggh .
hi .
oh great ! !
no ! , he 's fine . fish are very resilient animals you know . don 't worry , i won 't get another fish .
i can 't , i have to go home .
oh wow , a real evil canieval .
it 's only black when you 're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood .
what ?
well , then , i 'll take it up with her .
well , i 'm close to her . i wanted to meet the one that got away .
if your ass isn 't chapped , you are not a good-writer of note .
i 've adjusted , and thanks for asking .
... weeks .
we 're about to find out .
it 's too late to start over .
good girl .
oh , you 're more than okay .
... you want a menage on your wedding night .
uh . how about promoting a bridesmaid ? someone you know for at least forty-five minutes .
not you . you won 't be comfortable unless you 're distinctive .
... you hate weddings , you never go .
... just my bridal shower . and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one-thirty game .
... his snoring , yeah . he says it 's worse than ever . that snaffle one ... ?
bad games , bad towns , bad pay , bad flights , bad hotels , real bad food . homeless , rootless , lonely , maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four ...
gold nose hair clippers .
hello .
only . if he wants to .
he won 't get mad , huh ?
they 'll eat it anyway , you ever been to a walk ?
i love him .
that 's entirely understandable .
sir , this is important ! haven 't you ever in your life cut one corner , to make something important turn out right ?
he 's too proud to beg for help . and if you wait till this comes out , your offer will be like charity . completely humiliating .
then it could all come out , sooner or later . nobody should be in on this . just you and me . or , more correctly , i .
i told him , get the important stuff , kim 's ring . i 'll collect the inconsequentials .
nobody has . so far .
i need to make some calls . could i use ... your office ?
yeh , well my old machine kept eating messages . i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement , but finally ...
i need you .
dance ? you don 't dance ! you learn to dance ? ?
first girl i ever knew . who lets me give her a bath .
firenze .
till the gas ran out .
hey , cabs are expensive . i 'm cheap , remember ?
that would be a girl . i don 't even know .
never can tell .
michael ! !
like i said , dazzling .
well , you 've got the rest of your lives .
if you like .
it 's more than that .
you 've been the man in mine .
me either .
i mean , you commit to a wedding . and then it seems like ... this ... momentum , you know ? you forget you ... chose it .
the night we met .
we danced to it . just like this .
it 's just ... up there ... right in front of walter 's ... y'know , computer . if memory serves .
it means a lot .
a bad combination .
if san antonio sweeps sacramento ...
don 't speak !
i came here , looking for her .
no , it 's , uh ... a real big favor .
... and public relations is a big problem area for him .
like family , huh ?
... mr. julianne potter , prominent new york drag queen .
with those big , dark , haunted eyes . as if you were harborin ' some ... unspeakably ... guilty ... secret .
you 're much more his type .
you 're so good .
you 'll have to speak up .
bye , bye .
hi . come on in . mary !
sue was trying to get hold of you .
what crook ?
the hell he did . look , i 'll see you in the morning .

you bet .
now , sueleen , you know that 's not what we talked about right here in this very room .
yes , they were .

grace . i 'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim , if you feel up to it .
i said we 'd give you an interview . i never said we wouldn 't kill you .
ain 't love grand .

yes , sir .
i 'm keen with anticipation .
aside from the obvious ?
could i get a coke for mickey ?
without any further ado , mickey and mallory ...
so , what now ?

they 're mesmerising .
fine . julie , why don 't you make a food run ? what 's around here ?

the elders , mon ...
straylight . kitchen dock .
a place to tap in . i can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen .
they 're only guessing , but we can 't take any risks .
why not ?
and how do you suggest i do that ?
stick with her . i want the process to become second nature to you . we fly for freeside at dawn .
you see the couple up in the balcony ?
i find out now .
fine , ratz . thanks .
i an ' i , man . i an ' i .
this place empty as a tomb , mon .
the girl 3jane . we need her .
i 'll get you there . your problem is making it alive .
3jane 's the only person beside tessier that knows the code .
since armitage sold them a program on it . put them years ahead of the competition .
what ?
almost two days .
we 'll find out soon enough . if you don 't pull the splices out .
not when sense/net throws the going away party . they 'll be on our asses from now on .
sure ... maelcom 's a rude boy , right , maelcom ?
or a little self-indulgent to say the least .
shut up .
guess . although , what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
roger in op/ed . don 't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating .
and what is your policy ? that if you 're not getting any , no one can ?
no - it 's just a lot of pressure for your first piece , that 's all . i mean , it 's not a half-page article , it 's a major undercover piece , jos . look what rigfort did to dutton - and that guy 's his cousin !
just get in the van , josie .
can i just say -- i totally love ex- lax .
uh uh . i 'm disco barbie .
that you would trip on your barbie heels and i 'd get named prom queen ? did i say that out loud ?
umm- i don 't think you 're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983 .
yeah it 's french . there 's no accent aigue , so the e is soft .
why ?
betty .
rosalind and orlando . from `` as you like it '' ? shakespeare ?
so . you and roger in op/ed .
they hid my car --
i already checked . there are some pretty serious couples in there .
i 'm rob 's prom date .
i got an assignment from the paper . i 'm going undercover . back to high school .
i can 't do this .
no . josie , this is real .
i shouldn 't say that , because i 'm your teacher .
thanks . so do you .
yeah , i have .
i just can 't look at you the same way .
i finally found my story .
nah uh .
we 're very evolved .
maybe we should sit .
and heavy ...
nothing . w-w-what are you talking about ?
whatever it is , it 's none of your concern .
specifically .
maybe he doesn 't know ...
who 's lisa ?
and you don 't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing ?
jesse 's dead , lisa . freddy 's here .
he 's dead , you bitch .
not too far . my folks bought a place over on elm street .
only the wet ones .
he must 've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa . in the shower ! left bloody footprints all over the ...
shut up , grady .
just watch me . if anything weird happens - like if i start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here , you got ta try to bring me out of it . his me over the head if you have to . just don 't let me leave .
look at this car . are you kidding ?

how do we find him , kristen ?
why is that ?
thanks , max .
nancy ...
all i can say is this isn 't something that 's just going to disappear . you 're all going to have to face it . fight it . and if you 're willing to work together ... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears ... i think we can beat it .
this isn 't possible . and even if it is ... what the hell am i doing here ? did you drag me in here too ?
anything ?
there 's nothing we can do . it 's out of our hands .
just go . kristen needs you . keep her awake somehow . do it .

uh huh ... okay , we 'll be there . how is he , anyway ?
or maybe it 'll turn him back into a toad .
i thank you .
he missed me .

terry ... ?
a bum . look what you 're doing . you want to be brave ? firing lead into another man 's flesh isn 't brave . any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave . you want to hurt johnny friendly ? you want to fix him for what he did to charley and a dozen men who were better than charley ? don 't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle . that 's just what he wants . he 'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense . fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it truth is the gun drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little cap pistol .
take it easy .

by way of chicago ?
when we knock off let 's have a bit of a party . we 'll drink to god and ireland , its whiskey and its women , to joey and edie and death to tyrants everywhere ... . !
patrick , me lad , i 'm ahead of you .
okay .
you are the keepers of the damned . you two know them all . and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment . i want ... a decided change .

hey , you wan na test my limits , you better line up a couple dozen women on the ground ... cause i got no limits in the air !
i guess i 'm used to it . i 've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back .
they 're coming around for another pass . you got extra weapons and ammo ?
what color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral ?
what 's between you and her is between you and her . but here 's what 's between you and me . everybody has a hero , danny . and you 're mine .

why do guys do such stupid things ?
maybe they 'll be the next dion and the belmonts .
yeah . i 've got ta go . arthur 's picking me up soon .
don 't say that ...
i can 't . i 'm too embarrassed .
i 'm not going .
you mean my wang ? listen , it 's running real late .
you 're damn right ! jesus ! peggy ! you sure know how to spoil a mood .
i have to talk to you..
okay . listen , i cancelled the tickets for fabian . i thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant , chez tres .
right here . now sit down .
of course .
i 'll just set it right here .

that 's a day 's work . but if that 's what you want , maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday .
it must run in the family .
come on , where 's your enthusiasm ?
he 's very interesting . for all his pretending to be a tough guy , he 's really got the soul of a poet .
i shouldn 't have put you through that . it must have been agony . let 's do something .

evelyn , put her to bed .
i think i 'm way ahead of them .
look young lady , i grew up through the depression . i fought in the second world war . six days a week i get up and deal with the public , the bank and the bill collectors . and on the seventh day , when god rests , i don 't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool !

i wanted to get geoff out of l.a. just start things over , you know ?

well we 're glad to have you , marjorie . you can call me chase , by the way .

i 'm not hungry .

not especially .
my lettuce is wilting .
night , honey .
any women on board ?
kings are out of fashion . i 'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant . it 's an anti-trust action .
andy , you don 't want this .
lookit . lookit !
he died fast . and if we got any choice , that 's the way we should all go out . don 't you cry for johns . don 't you dare .
oh , sure . why not ? sounds like a hoot .
doesn 't seem like enough to turn back on , does it ?
well , guess if it was trickeration he 'd just do me , huh ? then again ... i am worth twice as much alive . didn 't know ? johns ain 't a cop . oh , he 's got that shiny badge an ' all , but nah -- he 's just a merc and i 'm just a payday . that 's why he won 't kill me . the creed is greed .
saw something i didn 't like .
hunger . i see 60 years of hunger .
think about what ?
we can 't make it .
you 're not leaving . not until we go back for the others .
cargo hold , everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo , lesgo , lesgo .
i know what 's in here !
probably right .
so i noticed . never seen a `` captain '' quite so ready to leave her ship .
so what happened ? where are they , then ?
i won 't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot 's throat .
'sokay , 'sokay . i killed it .
how much you weigh right now , fry ? huh ?
ask if anyone has anything in cargo ! anything to drink !
quiet , please . everyone .
and what about the cells ?
rain .
has anyone checked the coring room ?
i 'm born-again .
please ... this solves nothing ... please ... .
i 'll need a receipt for that . for all these .
like an emergency life-raft , right ?
oh , so i 'm disposable ?
we 're movin ' . and i 'm just wondering if i shouldn 't lighten the load right now .
only if we both get outta this alive . and there may be a way .
not afraid of the dark , are you ?
no . she 's not .
they been nose-open for her ever since we left . they go off blood .
just realized that , huh ?
what do you care ?
just wanted his o-2 . though i notice he tried to ghost my ass . when he shot up that stranger instead .
yes , sir , so it was -- thanks to you . but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written ...
it wasn 't difficult . only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone . i see you brought along the female of your species . i didn 't realize a man could be monogamous .
no one really knows . it 's an ancient taboo . set forth in the sacred scrolls . the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly .
right now , if you like .
no . you saved me from this fanatic . maybe i can pay you back .
and now you know the truth . cornelius has beaten you , doctor . he proved it . man preceded you here . you owe him your science , your language , whatever knowledge you have .
no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone . i 've been there . i 've seen it .
zira ... .
let 's find them all .
blessed are the vegetarians .
him .
these animals are dirty , doctor . they stink , and they carry communicable diseases . why aren 't they cleaned up before they 're brought here ?
learned judges : my case is simple . it is based on our first article of faith : that the almighty created the ape in his own image ; that he gave him a soul and a mind ; that he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle , and made him the lord of the planet .
sustained . your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature .
don 't be silly . he 's perfectly tame .
see ? he keeps pretending he can talk .
forget it . abandon ship .
we 're some three hundred and twenty light years from earth . on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion . that could be bellatrix .
what would you learn ? i 've told you where you are and when you are .
you 're our optimist look at the bright side . if that 's the best there is around here , in six months we 'll be running this planet .
i 'm for that .
in my world -- before i left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair .
my name is taylor .
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ?
all right , let 's see if you 're willing to put that statement to a test .
he might have been wiped out by a plague . natural catastrophe . like a fiery storm of meteors . from the looks of this part of your planet , i 'd say that was a fair bet .
listen , listen -- i can speak --
she 's not sick at all . she 's pregnant .
taylor , you can 't .
all right , but ... . ... you 're so damned ugly !
yes , sir .
sirs : our theories have a bearing on his identity .
he won 't survive . do you know what sort of life awaits you out there , taylor ? that of an animal . if you aren 't eventually hunted down and killed by apes , some jungle beast will devour you .
in a few minutes there will be no doll . there can 't be . i 'm sorry .
i 'll get him . you get the man in , taylor now . or i 'll article 15 both your asses . move !
kill you motherfucker ! ! !
you - you 're going to fuckin ' jail , buddy , you ain 't getting away with this one ! ! ! ! !
fuck this shit ! i ain 't dyin ' in no white man 's war ! ise didi-ing this motherfuckah !
you mean he 's crazy ? no more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long .
hang tough , gator . hang in there , man , you 're gon na be ok ... just hang on .
okay , here it is - one , we got gooks in the fuckin ' perimeter .
what didn 't she do . she fucked the living shit outta me , that 's what she did !
she was a crossbreed , chinese and polish .
fuck it , don 't mean nothing , no such thing here as a coward , done your best man , next time y'do better .
well sometimes a man jes don ' wan na go back . how you gon na talk to civilians man ? people back in the world just don 't give a shit , y'know what i mean , to them you 're a fuckin ' animal is all -
you a crazy fucker , givin ' up college man .
sounds like it .
knock it off ! we got two men need attention here . police up your extra ammo and frags , don 't leave nothing for the dinks . hoyt , junior , carry gardner .
they 're on their way ... there 's a gook village half a klik downriver , battalion wants us to move in and search it asap , something 's going on ... where 's barnes ?
maybe but i seen it happen at ia drang in '66 , first cavalry and they cut us to fuckin ' pieces ! give me three men , if i 'm wrong , i can still roll up that flank .
this ain 't taylor . taylor been shot . this man chris been resurrected ...
yeah , you done said it . revenge on us .
so he got a reduced and come over here . nam 's his freedom man , nam 's his pussy . three years he been here .
if you 're gon na do it man , 'least do it right .
that 's what he is ... baaaa !
my name 's larry mitchell . i live in vancouver .
i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do about it , mr. mitchell .
why certainly , baby .
next time you try that , mr. mitchell ... ..don 't . i 'm warning you .
possibly , miss .
i 'd rather wait until it does matter .
i 'm still on course to victoria . nobody saw you get on board , nobody seen you since .
i understand , betty . i understand perfectly .
i 'm not interested in blind dates .
in the same elevator . it is a public conveyance .
fascinated .
the new ones are fine . the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble .
i don 't like to be tailed . the lady i 'm with doesn 't like to be stared at . to put the matter in a couple of nutshells , i don 't like you .
you 're not english .
no thanks . i had some . how would you like to take a walk for , say , half and hour ?
delightfully . every time miss mayfield says something , i know less than i did before . well , i may as well knock off for tonight . good night , miss mayfield . do let me thank you for your cooperation .
the liquors lovely . the rest of the party you can have .
nothing to discuss . tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter . be grateful for small mercies .
oh , shut up ! you haven 't even got your spats on .
thank you . it is rather late ... and i 'm not young anymore . good night .
how important would it have to be ? it 's only murder , inspector .
the joint 's not open , mac . who 's brandon ?
they tell me he 'll be a great loss to the liquor trade . this mayfield girl ...
somebody did it twice last night -- in the dark .
warm water , no doubt .
when i give an order , you 'll not need it interpreted . you have an hour to make your mind up . well , are ye satisfied , mr. mitchell ?
two .
she is much younger than i am . that 's something i 'm going to have to get used to . isn 't it , larry ? they 'll all be much younger than i am . here . tear them up .
i say yes !
unsophisticated ? if i knew about this babe ...
he was delightful .
thanks .
that doesn 't matter . as long as we can get our message through to someone there . jill , where are those handouts ?
exactly that .
that 's her .
no , it 's all right . i can get a cab . night night .
you just might .
oh ... excuse me . there 's nicholas .
i know . i 'm sorry .
no jokes . james is in love .
voila !
no , bells beach , australia .
yeah , but are you crazy enough ?
my man !
whoa , whoa ! ! think it through ! i 'm the only one knows where they are . just let me talk for a second .
sorry , can 't do it , brah . he 's on the road . and where they 're going there 's no phones . damn , i hate this johnny , i really do . i hate violence . see , that 's why i need rosie . i could never make this thing work , myself . no way i could hold a knife to tyler 's throat , man ! she was my woman , once . we shared time in this world . but rosie , he 's kind of a ... mechanism . once you set him in motion , he won 't stop . that 's his gift , a kind of ... blankness . noon comes , straight up , he 'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes . nothing i can do , unless i get there .
shit ! !
shutup , you might learn somethin ' you 're not careful ... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over . there was a soil sample . non- specific mud traces of asphalt , oils , blah , blah ... sand and ... carnuba wax . so i became a wax expert . there 's 80 some uses for this stuff , something like five hundred products .
another month and we don 't see 'em again 'til next summer .
why can 't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned ? ask a few questions .
got it ...
patience hotshot . patience . it 'll be subtle , if it 's here at all .
thanks , buddy .
he 's pushing it through first thing . you better get some sleep tonight , it could be an interesting morning .
right here , partner .
no way . not yet . come on .
figured you did .
come on . at least no one 's gon na see how bad you are .
yeah , you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it , a big strong stud like you shouldn 't have any problem . right ? ! well you figured wrong , dork !
something ... in the trees ...
they 're getting better equipped every day .
the wound all fused , cauterized ... what the hell did this ?
no more games .
can 't say , major ... been squirrely all mornin ' ... fuckin ' weird ... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good ... smells things that ain 't there .
it 's been a long time , general .
that 's the problem . apparently they strayed off course . we 're certain they 've been captured by the guerrillas .
we figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . after that , there 's not much hope . we want a rescue operation mounted tonight . that doesn 't give you much time .
but i do know . i also know your lines of credit are over-extended . if i don 't buy your company , someone else will ... ah , the escargot .
i see . well . maybe that means you 'd have lunch with me sometime then .
i 'd like to find out . you don 't know anything about me either . that 's why people have lunch .
who indeed ...
to get me in a mood to sell -- double what i paid . but your company doesn 't have enough capital right now to buy anything .
how ?
i suppose you 'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don 't seem aware of , wouldn 't you ? the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours , you 'd certainly find out about that .
if you can figure it out , be my guest .
you don 't know habits , you think this is ugly .
i 've known a lot of everybody .
tsk . excuse me , i didn 't think he had change for a hundred .
they should be . they 're both good at it .
oooh , thank god .
... dollars ?
some game . screwin ' some poor slob out of his retirement .
not much to tell . i went to public school . went to university on scholarship . went to work for an investment firm . in eight years i owned it . my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after . i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces . one of the pieces was him .
vivian , what the --
i 'm glad you like it . now be quiet , i 've really got to read these .
yes ! and you don 't even know where you 're going !
bill stuckey , vivian . my wife , elizabeth .
hear me out . i 've known you a long time . i see a difference in you this week . like that tie . i 'm suddenly wondering if this girl 's not the difference . especially when i see her talking with david kross .
let him answer .
hi , viv . carlos , you know my roommate , viv .
and leave all this ? not in a million .
'scume me .
i just might do that .
i suggest a deal . you write four copies of a letter . i 'll send my four fastest ships . one in each direction . the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year . we 'll run up the white flag and deliver your message . if westley wants you , bless you both . if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide . are we agreed ?
yes . yes , of course . naturally , not those four .
they were both poisoned . i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
oh , my sweet westley ; what have i done ?
as you wish .
you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 58 .
no . no . we have already succeeded .
it 's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest . i don 't even exercise . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 38 .
i just want you to feel you 're doing well . i hate for people to die embarrassed .
well , i haven 't fought just one person for so long . i 've been specializing in groups . battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .
well ... ... you see , you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
anybody want a peanut ?
i 'm waiting !
if there are , we 'll all be dead .
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works ?
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back .
over the albino , i think .
right , right , sorry .
i 'll be right back .
oh . well , thank you very much . it 's very nice of you . your vote of confidence is overwhelming . all right . the princess bride , by s. morgenstern . chapter one . buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .
i don 't be-leeve this .
what is it ? what 's the matter ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 56 .
as you wish ...
death first ! !
i 'll beat you both apart . i 'll take you both together .
look who knows so much . well , it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead . there 's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead . please open his mouth .
if you 're in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 26 .
nothing comes to mind .
again . thank you .
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man . he was a great swordmaker , my father . and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job . he slaved a year before he was done .
naturally , you must expect me to attack with capo ferro .
then why are you smiling ?
that would be inconceivable .
i don 't swim . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 15 .
inconceivable !
you keep using that word -- i do not think it means what you think it means . my god ! he 's climbing .
there will be no arrangement -- -- and you 're killing her !
shut up . i 'm having a rhetorical conversation . how humiliating . max bialystock . max bialystock .
it 's nothing ... nothing .
i 'm turning myself in . it 's the only way . i 'm going to cooperate with the authorities . they 'll reduce my sentence and then there 's time off for good behavior . and maybe i 'll get a job in the prison library . so long .
with whom ?
it was the same thing in germany . we looked for years before we found the right hitler .
all right , but remember , if you damage the fuhrer 's reputation , i kill you .
i 'm not crazy . i 'm inept .
stop ! stop ! this is insanity .
send for goebbels .
just what he told your detective .
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so , sister .
you 're not .
neither will i .
someone was at that window . i saw the curtain move .
i 'm glad we didn 't .
los angeles .
don 't worry about it . but as long as you 've made us supper , we may as well eat it . huh ?
left phoenix under her own steam ?
i understand my husband is -- your assistant . may i see him please ?
sh -- sh -- i want to have a few words with you quietly .
take him to the psychopathic hospital .
well , you see , the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule . all of his advertising announced the opening tonight .
at any time . you will always be welcome .
they are . my boy , i think you are right . everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country , i am beginning to realize that i am a little tired myself . you can call that fellow in from the front . i think we 'll close for the night .
and i have no desire to hurt you . you will always be beautiful . think , my child , in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now .
nothing doing . this is my percentage . you birds are going to get yours . and anyhow , i found this dump .
get out of here .
so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong . don 't be sil , kid .
well , no one would ever suspect it . you don 't sound right .
better cut that out . that 's what happens to girls who bite their nails . what 's wrong ?
no -- no -- i -- i -- i don 't want to see it .
don 't ask any questions . come on !
i wonder if i could have her pose for me .
day or night ?
at the sub-atomic level , particles obey their own logic . they connect in unimaginable ways .
inside every semi-conductor ... you have two particles , with opposite charges , separated by an impassable barrier ...
no . no , i 'm all right . oh , god , what have i done ? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell ! i must be crazy , a child like you . oh , god , oh , lord . this is awful , this is terrible , i got ta get outta here !
well , he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day . but i don 't know who he is , buddy , i really don 't .
buddy , sex don 't mean a thing to me . it ain 't nothin ' but a mosquito bite . i 'll tell you a secret . girls don 't want sex , buddy , girls want love .
no . why should rose be in my room ?
no , she hasn 't . i think i hear a car .
no .
at least .
boy ! wow !
buddy , that was my place .
shut up , doll . i 'll cut your guts
here comes daddy .
no , darlin ' . just that damnable insomnia in reverse . i sleep like a baby for an hour then i 'm wide awake . you go back to sleep .
honey , please ...
just a moment , dear . we can 't have it , rose . can you behave yourself -- or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question . if you can 't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?
no , she doesn 't , she 's fine , fine . she 's perfectly healthy , don 't give her ideas .
i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition . i wash my hands or the whole thing .
honey , that 's no way to talk to the doctor , he 's merely doing his job , dear .
there are more on the other side .
my rose . it 's kind of like a motto . people will say , there comes rose with her rose .
yes , sir . i had to go to the bathroom .
where is he ? where have you got him hid ? ah , ha !
she has other things to do , dave .
mother , buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says i would too if i was grown-up . is it true , mother -- would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says ?
i don 't know . i think he 's cryin ' !
i beg your pardon , epi-zoo-tics ? do you mean `` epi-zoo-ot-tics , '' an animal epidemic ?
no , waski , she won 't die , because we are praying for her .
oh ... oh ... oh ! i think ... maybe ... one of 'em ... was foster ... but i don 't hardly know him !
be quiet , rose .
yes , ma'am .
i don 't mind .
cuff'em . let 's see what these two love birds say once they 're sitting in separate cages .
just entering . we 'll get to the breaking in a minute .
again .
whoa , thanks , man . these are cool . they 'll be collector 's items .
what do you want me to do about it ?
stop blaming yourself .
i got him .
lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes . it 's a tax dodge .
you 'll cry like a great big , blubbering baby .
just keep an eye out till i get this rig up and running .
... where ... where 's a jerk like me ever gon na find another girl to love him ... huh ? ...
i 'm waiting till the time 's right .
go wherever you want . live how you want .
whoops ... don 't mind me . go ahead and finish up .
shit . you 're right .
no you 're not .
i kinda already figured that , but keep those helpful hints coming .
all for one ...
out here . on your knees .
who is that ... ?
you mean , besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer ?
seatbelts fastened , please .
beholden to none .
proceed with the countdown . all groups assume attack coordinates .
all right . stand by .
we 'll last longer then we will against that death star ... and we might just take a few of them with us .
we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !
yoda will always be with you .
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view .
a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor .
strange , that i have not . i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear , lord vader .
then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them .
i have a promise i have to keep first ... to an old friend .
quietly , there might be more of them out there .
we got separated .
come on , artoo . we 'll need your scanners .
threepio , tell them if they don 't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic .
it 'll work . it 'll work .
it 'll take time . this whole party 'll be for nothing if they see us .
charges ! come on , come on !
here 's the terminal .
figured if i left you frozen like that you 'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life , so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later .
oh , well , someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab .
well , i suppose i could hotwire this thing .
let 's see .
form up . and stay alert . we could run out of space real fast .
i see them . wait , leia !
unfortunate that i know the truth ?
nothing . why do you think i should ?
on my mother 's grave .
you are - so quake with fear , you tiny fools .
dammit , janet .
yes .
oh , it 's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .
yes , dr scott . a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter .
cross my heart and hope to die .
you 're too kind .
they didn 't like me . they never liked me .
absolutely .
by accident ?
... no thanks .
don 't tease me .
they either say , 'kill the nigger ' or 'hope you die , honky . ' -- what ya got in the bag ?
ya right -- mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty , y'know .
... yes --
paul .
... i don 't feel heat from the name .
very high an ' very fast .
buy us some thunderbird , man .
pull heat on me ? -- i 'll dent ya face !
charge it .
not yellow , cautious . see , it 's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
he 's always in a bad mood . count ya blessin 's . ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
do i have to pay juice ?
where else am i gon na go . bet three grand on rocky .
message -- what message ?
hey , mickey -- whatta ya doin ' here ? here , sit down .
yeah , ya kinda remind me of the rock . ya move like 'im .
i never had good footwork .

he ain 't losin ' nothin ' .
open my eyes -- please , open my eyes !
inventin ' jokes ain 't easy .

yeah , sure -- she 's very excited .
try again , c'mon , try again .
... it 's cold outside , paulie .
my problem is i got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie .
yeah ? does he wear pants this color ?
what are you complaining about ? here 's your fifty bucks .
i don 't wan na think . i wan na drink .
stick to stuffin ' the olives , willya , dolores ?
dolores , meet roger rabbit .
i oughta have my head examined . will you hold still ?
if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this .
maybe baby herman was right . somebody wants acme 's property . cack the old man , pin it on roger , and destroy the will .
then why 'd they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it won 't open .
it wasn 't toontown they wanted . it was my idea of how to put the land to better use .
they won 't care . who 's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
okay , you 've seen me . now give me a towel .
don 't worry , you 're not the first . we better get out of here .
marvin told me . doom was after his land . ne was afraid . that 's why he brought me his will .
no one knows . he bought the election a few years back . he 's been rulin ' toontown ever since .
only there 's no business like it , no business i know .
aren 't you the lucky one ...
as soon as is humanly possible .
frankly , i 'm shocked . marvin acme 's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years .
divorce ? never !
you idiot . i lost the key for those cuffs .
my brother . get inside .
we can 't do anything till it 's dark .
i followed you to the maroon studios . when i heard those shots , i thought i 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk .
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage .
i guess i am at that . cigar ?
from this box here ...
but 't is no wit to go .
art thou hurt ?
madam , i am here . what is your will ?
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
ay , so i fear ; the more is my unrest .
leaving ...
and who are you ?
how do we know that ?
that 's why you were riding with him .
they 're good !
no , seamus . i heard you the first time .
i don 't know ... well i don 't ! it 's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you . but i do know who we 're working for . my people , and the russian mob .
ready when you are ...
you 'll die if you leave here .
no booze ... pain 's in the mind , and the mind i can control . alright , let 's do it .
call it a reckoning of character .
perhaps . but you are not healthy , and if you try i 'll kill you .
my way is better .
let 's just say he knows who i am .
that 's what i thought .
i asked if we could give him anything else .
gregor 's cell phone ...
if tony says this is it , then it 's it .
if i 'm going to die for the cia , i 'm going to go out smoking . besides , there 's half a forest between us and them , they can 't see a goddamned thing .
i 'll work on it ...
just to keep me company , sam -- i hate smoking alone . how about you ? i thought all you ira types smoked .
why didn 't you kill him ?
matter of face there 's this flick i 've been hearing about . i haven 't seen it , but from what i hear it 's pretty cool .
i can 't get enough of it .
i knew you 'd come through . jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave .
the horniest dog in nevada .
why ? are you kidding me ?
torch it ? !
man take it easy ! you 're sweating like crazy !
he 's a partner now , earl , like it or not .
for christ 's sake , booth , i just needed to take care of a few debts is all ! you got my word on it -- i 'm not going near it again until everything cools down .
yeah , i mean you 're coming unglued , jesse .
i don 't know ! shit , give me a break !
i 'm just making our intentions clear . go check the desk .
i can 't . i can 't go on . i can 't keep lying ... killing . that 's not me . that 's not us .
that 's the deal . if you don 't like it , forget it , no one wins .
you better believe it if you know what 's good for you !
maybe . that 's where it was during denning 's last report .
yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three .
i might have to look into that ...
i 'm in here .
you deserve it is the occasion .
well , i can 't let you down now , can i ?
yeah . i want to tell you everything .
you know i do .
first you question my integrity , then you call me stupid ... ... that hurts , son .
hell , i don 't know . if i had some input i 'd offer it up .
i wanted to ask you some questions about last night .
damn ! martin i 'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that . i thought maybe it would help . booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin , clearly relieved --
maybe i should come along .
did you say after midnight ?
well i just uh , you know ...
take it or leave it .
sort of .
a surprise huh ? well i don 't like any surprises , especially if i 'm forking over the loot for them !
we 're gon na talk .
well it 's not here -- you 're wasting your time and you 're pissing me off !
absolutely positively .
i ain 't his partner , i 'm a tourist . i got proof . see , i got a mini-bar key .
lee , you okay ?
are you kidding , they love me . i 'm a star , lee . a god to these people !
try to land on your feet .
i am a tourist .
don 't look at my ass !
it 's a bomb .
wait here . i 'll handle this .
amen to that , brother .
then you know i 'm not walking away from this case .
no . but i 'll help you .
now you know .
i still have my lunch money from third grade .
the secret service ? why ?
are you okay , lee ?
i 'll take him .
don 't .
don 't you remember ? i 'm already dead .
yes , master .
do i look like i 'm movin ' ? ! what you 're seeing here ? this is not movement . this is my `` still '' .
the bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity . if you want the ambassador 's daughter back alive , listen and do not talk .
don 't push it . you better watch your ass with these fed types . if there 's a screw-up , they won 't think twice about burnin ' it .
carter .
look , you want to work in this country , you got ta know this crap . okay ? we 're gon na be in some deep shit here . working the danger zone . and you need insurance . cause , you know , you might be starting some riots and shit .
oh yeah , but this is on the way . and you got ta see john wayne 's footprints . everybody does . it 's almost like a law . you can 't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big . tiny god damn feet !
took off . yes . they took off .
it ain 't your ass , it 's my ass you 're backin ' up . take the damn gun .
oh yes .
no way in the way ! i 'm talkin ' back up , johnson . i 'm in charge ! and i need you , baby .
don 't worry about the kidnapping , carter , the f.b.i . will handle that . your assignment is lee .
carter , shut up !
i wouldn 't touch that if i were you .
carter , can i have a moment ?
soon young , don 't worry . you will have many friends very soon . you will see . america is a very friendly place .
ike just came by to check out the team .
i 'm just bragging about how great you are . i 'm the luckiest man alive .
hold it ! hold it ! i think we 're taking this too fast .
how about -- `` i hope you 'll be very happy together '' ?
weird . like after all those years you would remem --
okay -- have a seat ... gently , carefully .
eight is good ... `` v '' could be victory .
his hair ... any color .
i merely write the stuff . you 're the one that serves it up .
i 'm sorry , too . wow . that only took us between years to say .
since when does ellie need moral supp --
no , i 'm not .
peggy phleming . not the ice skater .
no , she 's talking about your hair .
oh , sure . that was a long time ago . see , she 's not a man-hater at all . she 's very supportive of men ...
oh , yeah . scared the hell out of skipper .
got ta tell you this about my daughter . my daughter makes real good time , even in a long dress and heels . maggie may not be hale 's longest running joke , but she certainly is the fastest .
yes .
he is not !
you can turn that finger around .
how do i do it ? i 'm not that beautiful .
cindy the manicurist .
why don 't you let him sleep it off in the trunk . i 'll take you for a ride . then we 'll come back for him . keep an eye on him .
i kissed him back .
i love you , too .
me ?
yes , i 've seen it . and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me !
she 's the boss .
thank you , dad .
my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead .
today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth .
i got ta go . i 'll see you at work . walter , you scared me . don 't ever do that again .
walter , there 's something i have to tell you --
i think that 's what i 'm saying .
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
i saw her . she looked just like this --
well , it 's the same woman . and he was crazy about her . what is this ? this is from seattle .
walter and i are engaged !
we 'll move them --
well , okay . what 's the big deal ? if she 'll forget the new fireplace , i 'll marry her . just point me in the right direction .
h and g. hi and goodbye .
they called and asked for it . `` dear sleepless in seattle . you are the most attractive man i 've ever laid ears on . ''
you have to give them your phone number or they won 't let you go on the air .
good .
sleepless and son . baltimore .
she 's going to cook something for us ?
i thought i saw a black widow spider .
it was all they had .
hi . he should book now because we can get an excursion fare . jessica 's parents are travel agents and --
he 's over at the boat show . he 'll be by later . it 's so beautiful here .
i tried to talk to her ... it was like i knew her . weird .
i say we got ta take action . now .
hush ... not a word about the cake , hear ?
no . no . i can 't . if ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
okay . then , tomorrow , i take the kids with me to the picket line .
no , no ... the sheriff had enough of us . we drove him crazy .
bobby , bobby , bobby . rhymes with ...
get used to it . you 're in a very tenuous position on the food chain , hoss .
i was thinking alice cooper .
ouch .
how ?
no . but i 'm the only one with my sad story . and that 's how it 's gon na stay .
i can 't tell you .
i want to do this for you . i want to do something good for a change .
danny , it 's not what you think .
billy sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in gardena a few weeks ago . said you looked so bad , he barely recognized you .
guess it 's our turn .
oh ... that . ah , he was just juiced . he wouldn 't have did nothin '
a quarter of a million , jimmy .
the del ammo mall mostly .
not tonight .
personal protection . it 's a dangerous world we live in , jimmy , a very dangerous world .
no you think she 's a tweaker ?
hey , check it out ...
what ? !
yeah .
yeah , dickhead .
well , you know what they say , just because you 're paranoid , doesn 't mean everyone 's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat .
danny , he isn 't gon na find out it 's you . domingo was a slinger , he must have sold to hundreds of different people .
i can 't help it , tanner , you hit like a fucking girl .
after that ass-whipping you gave me ?
look man , i just wanted to make some dough and disappear . i didn 't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him .
we got the 411 on your good old boy .
yeah . okay . listen carefully ... you 're in the bathroom . you 've been shot in the shoulder ...
answer the fucking question !
hey , you want me to do all your work for you , numbnuts ?
i still don 't know what you 're talking about .
you mean the menacing red car ?
worse . much worse . a teacher .
i 'm making the small buy tonight ... if i don 't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something . if everyone is happy , we 'll do the big deal later in the week .
yeah . this could be the one we 're looking for .
that 's not good in prison . it 's just not good .
don 't we always take good care of you ?
i thought you were done .
the numbers don 't make sense , sir . his brothers are dead , that 's too bad , but they 're out of the equation . sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away . one private is simply not worth a squad . colonel anderson this one is . he 's worth a lot more than that . which is why i 'm sending you , you 're the best field officer there is .
yep , you step on a rusty nail , get lockjaw , never say another word as long as you live .
i guess .
like hell , you did .
that 's not all . there were nine gunners on the eighty-eights , one had a broken heel on his boot , two had bratwurst for supper last night , one of them is named fritz , the other , hans , maybe , i don 't know , it 's hard to tell .
you think the rest of us were ?
thank him and tell him we 're sorry about his loss .
same place we are .
you don 't count .
those guns are close .
i teach english at addley high school in addley , pennsylvania .
i changed my mind .
i 've got a line on one .
that 's not what we 're here for .
it doesn 't take this .
about to pour his sulfa . sees the wound . stops . knows it 's fatal .
yes , sir .
sure , meet me at the top , we 'll start the paperwork .
stay at it until you get fire control . keep 'em down , wait for the navy .
stands on the edge of the woods , almost in a trance .
upham , are you sure you 've never been in combat ?
you have orders , too .
we can 't leave it here .
is silent . motionless . he gently closes wade 's eyes . his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags . he fumbles and drops it . sarge notices .
looks like tea time , maybe they 're brits .
get back to your positions !
that 's not where i am . miller no ? where are you ?
knows what that means . he hears the rumble of the tanks .
no , private , i want you to stay here , keep your head down , don 't do anything brave or stupid .
struggling with a pair of germans .
looks at miller , sees him growing weak , starting to sway . he gently tries to move miller aside .
as i was saying , before i was so rudely interrupted , my grandfather got old , as grandfathers tend to do . he needed someone to take care of him . we move around all the time , going from one mine to another , so we had to put him in a home . nice enough place but kind of depressing . but not for granddad . he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship , going to tahiti , he had his own cabin , first class , with room service . it just so happened that the weather was always lousy , so he never bothered to go up on deck . happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died .
hey , i got a mother . jackson , you got a mother ?
get lost .
he 's fast , captain , i saw him .
who knows ? it worked .
listen , i don 't know your name , but what are you doing for lunch ?
i just washed this shirt , didn 't i ?
forget it , forget it , it 's mine , it 's mine !
okay , i got it .
lloyd , you have to understand her family is being ripped apart . like you and she were ripped apart . like joe and i were ripped apart .
diane court does not realise how good-looking she is .
i 'm sorry . it 's just you 're a really nice guy , and we don 't want to see you get hurt .
he 's got that nervous talking thing . i told him not to speak .
i 'm going to take out diane court again .
okay , i promise i will . just come here a minute , i want to show you something .
we 'll worry about that later . now come on , tell me that you 're special .
dad , no . but i didn 't want any problems , so i decided not to sleep with him .
well then don 't pick it up . you know what 's best .
just finishing up in here .
y'know , you 're not in england yet , you know that of course , and by the way , i want to just tell you that i lived in england for a few months ,
yeah , i 've had it forever . i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up .
yeah .
you 've got ta get her out of your head , man .
alright !
my plant manager is somewhere on this train . if it leaves with him on it , it 'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why .
a charade ? how could it be a charade ?
yeah , i can .
takes diamonds to stay on this list .
nice things cost money .
things are great , things are great .
they should be .
do what ?
thank you .
oskar -
give or take what , stern - how many - count them .
yes .
no , no , what , what is it ?
of course he 's stealing from me , we 're in business together . what is this ? i 'm sitting here , suddenly everybody 's talking like this is something bad . we take from each other , we take from the army , everybody uses everybody , it works out , everybody 's happy .
thanks , dewey , but i was thinking i 'd pull jesse off ...
37 usages of himbry located in the registar 's office . 9 tatum 's , 47 riley 's . and that 's just on campus . it 's hopeless .
find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name ...
on national television .
it 's hell week . chill . the movie murders have brought out the crazies . it 's nothing .
gale , i don 't know what i 'm doing from one moment to the next . i 'm just taking it as it comes .
where do you think he got it ? mental illness is heriditary . who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother ? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance .
hey , it 's cool . hallie 's into it , i 'm into hallie ...
sid , you don 't have to .
i think it 's out of your control .
youre not going to get away with this .
yeah , how can we help ? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life ?
not good .
c'mon . let 's go .
it 's what you want from me .
but who would operate your camera ?
i got . i got it . friday the 13th , part 20 .
is sid in therapy ?
what ?
but i love you . and i want the whole world to know it .
i 'd really just like to be alone .
it 's not a good idea , hallie .
i counted four .
is that cool ? just to leave her like that ?
this has nothing to do with me , joel . there 's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time . i can 't control that . who 's hungry ?
guys , guys , i 'm sorry but , no way .
but ...
anytime . sorry it sucked . it just had that been there done that feeling .
there 's more .
police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .
no .
jesus christ dewey help me ! they tried to kill me in the bathroom ! the killers !
he wasn 't superhuman dewey . he wasn 't superhuman at all .
amen boy scout , now answer the fucking door !
just what the hell do you people think you 're doing , barging in here like this ? i 've got important calls to make . i run this studio .
sure .
i don 't know . screw them . look , what 's important is that we stick together . no matter what . if anyone is next it 's you or me jen .
no ! he 's not dead ! he 's still breathing ! look !
good twist .
gale weathers ? ! what are you doing here ? no press on the set ! no press , no press on set ! get that woman out of here .
who ?
hi , gale . i 'm glad you 're all right .
great . a spirited one . i 'll be seeing you real soon sidney . real soon .
it 's good to see you again sidney . i was growing real impatient . go ahead . explore . i 'll catch up with you later .
you know it .
i was hoping sid and i could talk .
odds are -- she 'll miss anyway .
where the fuck did she go ?
i 'll only stay a sec .
i 'm going ... i 'm going .
what 's that ?
it 's okay . we need to talk .
ssshh ... everything 's gon na be okay . i promise .
it 's okay . give me the gun .
why ? why ? did you hear that , stu ? i think she wants a motive . hmmm ... i don 't really believe in motives , sid . i mean , did norman bates have a motive ?
not so fast . we 're gon na play a little game . it 's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass ?
because i want to know who i 'm looking at .
more of a game , really .
they 'd never make it in time .
go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again .
answer the question and i will .
your call .
twenty-five , huh ? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males , 11-24 . i just missed you . of course , you don 't look a day over twelve , except in the upper torso area . does the force require that you work out ?
you are precious . please , call me gale .
i don 't think you 're so bad .
hold up a sec ...
don 't be so self-righteous . it 's just a little blow out -- we 'll be perfectly safe .
hey , i saw that movie . true story , 'bout some killer in texas .
thanks , dewey . but with my luck they 'd cast tori spelling .
how is everything ?
the phone 's dead .
forget it .
and it fucked her up royally . think about it . it makes perfect sense . her mom 's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world , she 's disillusioned , where 's god , etc . completely suicidal . and one day she snaps . she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year . and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression .
ricki lake .
that 's the original part .
if you hang up , you 'll die just like your mother .
you got it .
yeah , casey and steve were completely hollowed out . takes a man to do something like that .
i had 'em hid in the foreign section .
don 't listen to him . it 's him . he 's the one .
no , sid .
hey , stu ? didn 't you use to date casey ?
you guys can go up to my parents room ? to talk and ... whatever .
her dad 's out of town . she 's staying with us .
i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ?
it was him , tatum . i know it .
he better not be . i told stu to keep his mouth shut . i think we can live without everybody 's all american for one night .
with stu , there 's little time to stop and reflect . but sometimes before , to relax and get in the mood , i think about grant goodeve .
i don 't know , they just did .
that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct .
i did . he 's full of shit .
tits -- see .
he wouldn 't just turn himself in . it doesn 't make any sense .
you 're wound too tight , mills . let it go .
ease back , mills .
everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible . also ... this shouldn 't be his first assignment .
he 's not finished .
shut up !
you always have to find one singular thing to focus on . there 's always one thing , and it may be as small as a speck of dust , but you find it and focus ... till it 's an exhausted possibility .
this is a premeditated puzzle , and it 's only the beginning .
whoa , whoa ... what ? !
can we talk about this in private ?
detective mills here . honey ... i asked you not to call me here . i 'll call you back ... what ? why ?
hello .
even if they did , those photos were taken before forensics .
just wait !
i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch . see , i was doing really good up till then . lots of street busts . i 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . i got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . next thing i know , the mayor 's pinning a medal on me . picture in the paper , whole nine yards .
i don 't know ... like fifty .
let 's go .
i 'm trying , alright ? just tell me what we 've got .
call for help , and you 'll live . but , you 'll be disfigured . or , put yourself out of your misery .
no , actually , i wasn 't sure at all .
big surprise .
when do we get to question him ?
what did you say ?
i can 't let you do this ...
i ... i don 't understand .
no matter how often i see guns , i still can 't get used to them .
too long . what do you think so far ?
if you can , please call me . please . i have to go now ... goodnight .
i 'm sorry , i only ...
i don 't know .
they gave up ... went back to the cotton rows ... so 'd the jamisons ... without martha , i don 't know ... she wouldn 't let a man quit .
you 're my brother ... you 're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to ... ain 't that so , martha ?
don 't argue ! ... and stay close ... maybe they 're rustlers ... and maybe this dodderin ' old idiot ain 't so far wrong ...
it 's not a sword , ma ... it 's a sabre ! did you kill many damyankees with this sabre , uncle ethan ?
huh ... ? no ... no water .
i ain 't wearing no gun .
now , now ... let 's not grow dis- putatious ...
why ? you wanted for a crime , ethan ?
just keep goin ' ...
how far 's the river from here , mose ?
comanches don 't use their fists , reverend ... let 'em alone ...
i 'm clayton .
yesterday , one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago ... he talks crazy but i brought him along ... says he lives here ... keeps mentioning a rocking chair .
grab hold ! ...
they have done ... nothing ... they are my people ...
where 's scar , mose ... scar ?
ain 't yours yet .
no ... nor build bonfires ... nor beat drums neither . i 'll meet you on the far side .
must 've ... anyway , i ain 't goin ' back to look for it ...
get some sleep ... tomorrow 's another day ...
no ... our turnin ' back don 't change anything ... not in the long run . if she 's alive , she 's safe ... for a while ... they 'll keep her to raise as one of their own , 'til she 's of an age to ...
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he 's chased it enough ... then he quits ... same when he runs ... seems he never learns there 's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin ' on ... so we 'll find them in the end , i promise you that ... we 'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth .
maybe i 'm gettin ' like mose harper -- my bones is cold tonight ...
what 's that ?
scar ?
what 'd the soldiers have to kill her for ! ..
debbie , you 're comin ' with us ! hear me ?
over there !
what 's goin ' on ?
i am ... i am ... it 's just that i know martha 'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls ... and if the girls are ... dead ... ethan , don 't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance !
a little comanche squaw - squaw !
ain 't worth the mendin ' ...
shush ! ... time for bed anyway ... likely these 'll need some takin ' in ... oh , martie , you 're that gaunted ! ... ma 's havin ' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and ...
`` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
in the cellar , i think . wait , i 'll take care of it .
i just had a really strange experience .
hey , take your time . you know time heals better than any shrink ever can .
you know , it 's not always easy for me , either . but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis .
come on , at least try one . it took me two hours to make these .
yeah ... i have to go to town .
why not ? she can guard the house . by the way , i gave her a name : clara .
i went to see prof. roth ! you know , i had another one of those dreams last night . i saw tommi !
hi , darling .
we loved each other once . have you forgotten that ?
your book - that 's why you were always in the cellar !
... so he 's dictating you a new bestseller ? whatever that is , it 's not our son .
i wouldn 't have made it by myself .
you don 't remember ?
oh no , no . you 're not bothering him . he has lots of time since he 's been retired .
thank you . elisabeth , i didn 't mean to ...
does this dog here belong to you ?
you know , i saw him sitting outside your gate ... oh , i 'm sorry , i 'm forgetting my manners again ! i haven 't even introduced myself yet . hi , my name 's lindner . karl lindner .
i appreciate your concern , but we live in that house . i need to know what happened in there .
just call me elisabeth .
i guess someone lost their key . you did get your tetanus shots , i hope ?
not so bad , if i could get some peace and quiet around here .
the speech is excellent . `` oh , then i see queen mab hath been with you ! '' excellent and a good length . but then he disappears for the length of a bible .
see you in jail .
ned is wrong for it .
who is that ?
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment .
the apothecary ? will , what is the story ? where is the shipwreck ? how does the comedy end ?
sad and wonderful ! i have a blue velvet cap which will do well , i have seen apothecary with a cap just so .
nobody knew !
is it about a pirate 's daughter ?
rosaline ? you mean ethel .
by god , will , if you do not , who does ? let us have pirates , clowns , and a happy ending , or we will send you back to stratford to your wife !
`` is the day so young ? ''
i will .
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes ; and but thou love me , let them find me here .
so this is the favour you find in the chamberlain 's men .
i have to get back .
it is strange to me , too .
of course you have not ! i have not written it !
i 'd like to ask you about your hobbies .
or maybe just phone out for a pizza ?
what ? oh , yeah , sure , if you want . i tell you , every letter this guy writes to you is the same : they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography . i dream of your thighs , the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire , while i , aroused and inflamed -- '
it 's not for me . it 's for love and happiness forever .
you were magnificent .
because that 's no good . remember , we did what we did , we took the money . it was a material calculation . but what 's the use if it 's underground , or in some funny bank in some funny place ? if you can 't spend it , if you can 't have it , what use is it ? none . it 's nothing , all for nothing , if you do that . i didn 't get into this for nothing , so that i could have nothing --
well , i 'm not expecting anyone either .
we were just sorting things out .
that 's what i thought he said .
let him go . let him take it all .
someone lost the key .
yeah , that 's right , that 's it .
do you smoke ?
keep it going , alex . you 're unstoppable now .
yes .
alex , i think it 's time for you to stop .
yes . they 're my friends .
with a face like this ?
it was on the television .
one other thing . do you have any tattoos ?
lester , don 't you think that uhh --
no .
do you ? you still see him ?
i don 't want to ... i swear ...
shut the door , lester . what do you think this is , a picnic ?
-- mmm --
she 's heavy . see , norman expects me to get in here , take care of all the customers and then do his show out in norwalk . i got ta have my own shop , just out of self defense .
hello .
i 'm very tired , george .
oh , christ .
jesus .
sure .
oh yeah .
oh jesus christ .
oh , i 'm sorry .
they 're yorkies and they don 't shed .
you know what 's wrong .
now i 'm embarrassed to tell you .
-- oh i don 't know --
you mean when are you going to egypt ?
i 'm telling you he won 't know the difference .
well ... that 's wonderful -- i 'll stop by there for a drink .
what was the donner party ?
come here for a minute , first .
okay .
french fries and ketchup .
yeah .
yeah .
i won 't , mom .
red rum . red rum . red rum . red rum .
mommy saying , 'wake up , wake up , wake up danny , wake up . '
yes .
mrs. torrance , most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained . they are brought on by emotional factors , and they rarely occur again .
ah he dislocated his shoulder .
well it 's just one of those things . you know ... purely an accident , um . my husband had oh ... been drinking , and he came home about three hours late , so he wasn 't exactly in the greatest mood that night . and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room ... and my husband grabbed his arm , you know , and pulled him away from them . it 's ... it 's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know , in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just ... used too much strength and he injured danny 's arm .
awfully nice of you to say . of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree .
fine .
why no , sir . i don 't believe so .
grady ... oh .
oh , that 's just great . how do you folks like our hotel so far ?
nice to meet you .
thank you for saying so .
women ! can 't live with 'em . can 't live without 'em !
good evening mr. torrance .
uh ... huh .
hmm , nice .
ah , come on hon . don 't be so grouchy .
i 'm not going to hurt you .
well , my predecessor in this job
no problem . in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat .
oh ...
oh well they 're really gorgeous . as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i 've ever seen .
oh , i 'll say .
boy , i bet you we could really have a good party in this room , huh hon ?
yes , well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday , but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
how do you do ?
fine .
damn near . now i 'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised , but you two are going to bed . go on , now , scoot .
jane-
a bunch of men getting ready to pretend they 're clint eastwood ... marty , didn 't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies ?
yes ... you 've always been that to him . but if you can 't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home , you better just stay away .
see me around to my car , marty , and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long .
you lying sleazeball ! the best years of my life ! what am i , garbage ? am i lint ?
i feel sorry for you , vincent . and i forgive you .
i love my heddles . show me again .
no way . we 're a choir , right ? headliners . the big room . two days a week won 't cut it . every day .
um , i don 't really know this one ...
that 's true , wouldn 't that be great . of course , we never know when things are going to change . any one of us could be transferred to another convent , tomorrow .
now stop that . you didn 't shoot at me . you were only trying to help , to give me experience . i tried to explain that to reverend mother , but -- i don 't know if she understood .
they 're from my old convent .
she 's got nothing to do with this . let her go .
can do .
very well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you .
safest place in the world . you think vince would look for you here ?
but it 's a nightmare ! mother superior is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture !
no -- worried about you . personally .
that depends . sisters , you don 't know this , but reverend mother 's been making all sorts of noises about resigning . that 's bad news . i don 't know if we could sing , if we thought that was true .
a hiding place .
they open a window .
maybe .
willy -- hit the lights .
she 's a broad ! got it ! just some broad !
no smart-ass remarks or nothing .
for like , twelve zillion eternities ?
is it worth it ? a lot of witnesses here .
dress rehearsal at four , performance at 8:30 . sharp .
we 're losing it .
that should have tipped us .
we can 't leave it up to the feds !
oh , she 's doing just fine , reverend mother -
but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun ?
which convent was that , sister ?
really , mary clarence ? were you a choirmistress ?
that was exciting !
it 's brought people back to the church .
we 'll pray -- and she 'll be there .
yes -- two men -- and they had guns .
but how do we get there ?
a benedictine .
christy .
her whereabouts are unknown , and we must proceed without her . pull yourselves together .
but where ?
we can save this young woman 's life , and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture .
and you 'll face that danger head-on . as if i could stop you . and you have my complete support in this matter . anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing .
she did . bring her back . now . for a talk .
i love you , chris . i always will . i gave you so much . my time . my affection . a big-time career . and how do you repay me ? what 's the thanks i get ? where 's the loyalty , huh ? where 's the love ?
are you nuts ? she 's not a nun . it 's christy . she 's a babe !
well enough . your gathering does honor to the deceased .
sarah has gone missing ... my servant girl . her things are gone . damn it . she has joined the migration out of town . what about breakfast , woman ? or , am i to starve to death ?
well , unless your name is baltus , you should not worry over mine .
two days ... ? for murder ?
to place it inside its coffin .
you will stay at her side ?
would you stay , doctor ? i may need assistance .
pardon me ?
when a goblin leaps from the nether world , others follow . poltergeists of the air , water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations !
well ... that might be ... helpful .
van ripper and his wife agreed to take him . they have children and a good home and good land .
`` let loose his silent shrieking . '' who knows , till we work at it ? i admit not being anxious to find out . `` he who holds the horseman 's desire will guide his reaping hand . '' whatever the horseman 's desire is , other than extinguishing lives .
there are none for magistrate philipse either . `` paasch , james '' `` pieter , thomas '' `` pos , william . ''
things have become complicated . katrina is at the mill . ride ahead , find her and bring her to meet me outside the church . find her at all costs . quickly .
you do not know all that has happened . you can not understand .
i ... i am looking for baltus van tassel .
he ... he tries to take the heads ... they will not pass .
i 'm drawing bad blood from the wound .
it is a prime tenet of science , philipse , that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical .
i can show exactly .
to the best of your recollection , where did the open wound fall ?
i didn 't see none .
yes . here ...
close your mouth ! keep silent .
doctor , he is awake .
see there . thinks of the simplest thing first .
okay , stop back by . don 't worry about your boy here , he 's doin ' good .
karl 's my name .
goddamnit , i 'm talkin ' to the man . you set right there , karl .
don 't talk about daddy . y'all go on to the garage and let me be .
if y'all don 't shut up i 'm gon na go out of my mind . and plus you 're liable to bust a spring in karl 's head . he 's already off balance .
that 's funny . you go to bed and take snot nose with you .
i thought i told you to keep out !
you 're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then . it wouldn 't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ain 't afraid of shit . you think i 'm afraid for you to stay here . you 're just a humped over retard it looks like to me . not really , i 'm just jokin ' with you . welcome to our humble home , buddy . frank needs all the friends he can get . frank 's a real weak little kid . his daddy taught him how to be a pussy .
you shut up you , fuckin ' retard . get your shit and get out of here . that was a wake-up slap , frank . remember . reality , like i said . don 't forget any bit of what i said to you and we 'll be fine .
i reckon .
hey , sweetheart . what you up to ?
naw , i don 't want to . me and karl got things we need to do .
i don 't know . he just said he 'd eat out there .
i stay on my feet all the time at work . i just can 't find shoes that 's comfortable .
i reckon .
he 's a-carryin ' me to look fer work in millsburg where i was borned .
i don 't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy . you 've been real square dealin ' with me . the bible says two men ort not lay together . but i 'll bet you the good lord wouldn 't send nobody like you to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades . that boy lives inside of his own heart . hits an awful big place . you take care of that boy .
i know .
hey karl , you know what ? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february . isn 't that somethin ' ?
uh ... my friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale .
this is april lee , auggie . april , say hello to auggie wren .
nothing much . he said his socks and underpants were dirty , and would we mind driving up with his things . fucking kids , huh ? they take you for granted every time .
it 's tommy 's . the sucker owed me a favor .
hi , auggie .
you told me you wanted to meet him . well , here he is .
anything , auggie . just name it .
are you making fun of me ? i won 't be mocked . do you hear me ? i won 't let no punk kid stand there and mock me !
help ? what the fuck do i need your help for ? i 've got a man , don 't i ? that 's more than you can say for yourself , hawkeye .
i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes . they came with a free gift coupon in every pack .
same here . but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon . you know , to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture , and he said it would be okay .
excuse me for asking , but you aren 't married , are you ?
good . i 'm glad that 's settled !
it 's all right . i really do know them .
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time . in my own time ... .
keep it tonight . we 'll catch fish . i 'll see ya back on the docks ...
why not ?
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .
why ? we 're only talking .
well , i don 't do it for just anybody .
i lie to my parents every day . and every night .
look at my face . it 's the face of the people who did that . my father hardly speaks english . we 're in bad trouble , you have to see that .
agnostics don 't believe or disbelieve , ma . we just don 't pretend we know .
seattle boys think he 's guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
what else ? i had the boy teach me kendo . including ... the importance of the bow .
nossir . i 'd gone to tell the wid ... to tell mrs. heine .
objection ! speculation .
that 's how journalists . answer questions .
he said he didn 't want that life no more . he 'd been saving to buy a farm . he was sorry i got sick . but pretty excited to get back his father 's place .
since september . last guys got transferred .
shorthard the radio transmis- sions , write 'em up , file 'em in a cabinet . nobody ever looks . just take up space .

don 't prove there was two lanterns . coulda been the one in the cabin .
no , you don 't .
yes , he was .
the freighter started through at 1:42 . the sea water seeped into carl 's watch and stopped it . at 1:47 .
he hit his head . on the way in .
it 's a rare thing . takes a turning point .
i was checking the cables .
look , no way i 'm lettin ' you out there . in a half hour you could be in canada .
your daddy played . i asked , down at the japanese community center . you smoke cigars ?
i think you like learning .
you 're wonderin ' ... how come i never ask . if you did it .
i want you . to tell the truth .

daphne , you 're bothering us .
and what are you trying to do to poor sugar ? putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent - nobody talks like that ! i 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
i 'm just borrowing them . you 'll get them back tomorrow .
i may throw up .
first thing we got to do is get out of these clothes .
we 're not on the pier yet -
i 'm sugar cane .
i don 't want you to think that i 'm a drinker . i can stop any time i want to - only i don 't want to . especially when i 'm blue .
sssh . sweet sue .
we 'll rent some at the bathhouse . how about you , josephine ?
she 'll rub it on me - and i 'll rub it on her - and we 'll rub it on each other - bye .
just a little trick i picked up in the elevator .
vanity fair ?
oh yes , we do !
i met one of them .
oh - here and there - and around .
oh - those . i don 't know . mice ?

nellie , get me long distance . what is it ?
there are two things i will not put up with during working hours . one is liquor - and the other one is men .
so do i . but don 't worry - we 'll be seeing a lot of each other .
she doesn 't need one . i don 't have one either .
yes , you 're in the way . he 's waiting for a signal from his yacht .
it 's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean , shell oil and everything -
yes - that 's our hurricane cellar .
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up .
i 'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - i think he 's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve .
i don 't know . all of a sudden , i 'm thirsty .
i told you - i 'm not very bright .

oh , dont be that way .

yeah , kind of .
and you do now ?
i have regrets .
its not supposed to be anything , kat . its just my rather feeble attempt to ... . oh , i dont know . you see , i thought i could deny my feelings --
exactly . i want us to look like we fit , but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit . its welcome cocktails , not prom . with this level of matchy-matchy , we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere .
oh , yeah . so we split it . you know , as in share . people do that .
love .
okay .
oh , come on . youre like the yoda of escorts .
not if you take an advance on your credit card .
its my job .

spontaneously combust ?
i didnt say he was worth it .
thank you .
i wasnt saving you from him . i was saving you from yourself .
close . sydney . turns out , i missed the rain .
i havent thought about that in years .
is there any other way to take it ?
what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource : your daughter .
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them .
-- and the ass of the man who adores her .
i try ...
that 's right --
where is africa , miss johnson ?
and you 're a tired little boy . i 'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep .

what has the world come to ? this is horrible . we 're locked up , burning books , hating other people-
no , dude , all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works .
yeah , but you know , i learned something today . i learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid ... you all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing ... to love each other .
yes ! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut ! ! i am sorry young man , but i have had it up to here ! strap them in !
wake up , people ! we all have to do things that aren 't pretty sometimes ! it 's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for ! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals ?

well get used to it , 'cause here we are , on the cruise of a lifetime .
i 'm sure i will .
hello second mate barnes . i was instructed to come to the bridge .
they are awaiting further information .
my ... wings ...
well it 's a good thing that i did .
ain 't it the truth . the two say nothing for a beat -
uh ...
yeah yeah yeah , give me a minute here .
that 's very professional sounding of you , taylor .
taylor , you surprise me .
sure you do . sending mac out on a little recon work . how pathetic . problem is it seems mac blew a few fuses . or maybe he 's just a little drunk . were you partying with a robot taylor ?
i know , i know .
don 't say that ! it ain 't over till it 's over !
just don 't move around too much .
well , plus the money ain 't that bad . dawn so , tell me , do you think everyone gets their million dollars ' worth on this trip of a lifetime ?
i don 't know .
suppose you didn 't have to hold your breath ?
yeah , let 's hope he can find a way through .
even if we do , it might be too late .
i understand .
at this point i 'm ready for anything .
don 't worry about me . where are we going ?
yeah , but you didn 't answer my question .
it was no time to lose my partner . we 're going to have to hurry , he 's on to us .
the room is filled with poison gas . the hydraulic system must have blown .
you too .
good . in that case , i pronounce us man and wife .
are you nuts ! it 's too risky !
send it back if you don 't want it .
i 'll tell you what you 're gon na do . you 're gon na stay put like taylor said .
mac . what 's shaking ?
one moment please ... one moment please ...
yes . you can enjoy some wonderful views from there .
i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector .
that 's affirmative .
look sid , a buzz burger . the faz 's favorite lunch . sid reaches for the plate . buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from sid .
no , pinhead , he ain 't here to bowl .
what do you want with old man faz ?
you afraid we 're gon na steal it ?
are you guys bruddas ?
wait ! that 's an aria !
nothing going on here , everybody stand back . let him through , ladies . ladies , please . as they start to move through the female throng , a little girl pops out in front of them , holding her ball .
kastle 's daughter 's been lookin ' for you .
i 'm your son . you 're a hard father to find .
you knew her . you married her in 1963 .
he says that to all his wives .
i am underground .
sheila !
it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .
if i find out buzz is comin ' up short on dwarf bowling , it 's lights out for him and pink slips for you . sid and breeze look sideways at each other .
ssssh ! now real quiet . on three . one ... two ... three !
bowling `` center '' !
yippy !
mine , and they never tip .
yeah , babylon . buzz runs the lanes there for my dad . everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad . theo splits .
really ? i kinda like it .
... lane six . yes .
tell me what happened theo .
they 're like pink snow , sir . sticky .
fletcher , i want you back here .
basic english ? there 's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet .
how about i just press the button ?
yeasts ? thank you , beth , but i don 't think we 're gon na open it up and find a loaf of bread .
how long will that be ?
two and a half days ?
you 're a fucking biochemist , aren 't you ? can 't you tell us something .
do you see it ?
pull it , damn it !
what team ?
press ? no , i haven 't .
i don 't know . but it 's something alien .
but sir , i think it 's imperative . i think the messages , the animals we 've seen , what killed edmunds , the reading you got earlier -- i think they 're all related .
you see the lever on the green box ? upper right hand corner ?
harry ? can you copy ?
send them , damn it ! i know , but i 'm not gon na be held responsible --
they 're coming .
if the subs aren 't here yet , sir --
in a minute , sir .
ted seems to have some ideas .
it 's nonsense . there 's enough difference between our own species to prove that .
we 're all very proud of you , harry , but what the hell is it ?
it 's not ignorant .
duly noted , ted . edmunds , try using suction .
what are you going to do -- shoot her ?
maybe it 's a message of some sort , you know ? see this red here .
ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now !
get out of there . i don 't want anyone going anywhere outside , understood ?
give him a chance . he 's speaking our language , not the other way around .
too big ?
yeah . drowning .
good theory , ted .
disrupt our brain waves , interfere with our ability to think .
beth .
i have to reset the sub .
must be . and if it is -- it 's a part of him not even he can control .
why would harry go back to using a code ?
don 't you know ?
from you , norman . from your mind . you 're doing it .
i 'm a woman . i don 't theorize . i only deal with facts .
who says it 's a he ?
you 'd have to ask them .
cannibalism , to be extreme . and now we 're talking about a new life form . their values and ethics may be incomprehensible .
another attack ?
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human . if it doesn 't look human , it 's a reptile or a big insect or something , having human values , human understanding .
gim me another explanation .
stop what ? what are you -- ?
shut up and open the door .
shut up and catch .
i 'm trying . there .
gim me some room here , will you ? back off . gim me some space .
it 's not a discharge . right , edmunds ? you said before , right ? so it 's got ta be a message .
just that . careful , it 's heavy .
sure , why not . give him the trophy . that pretentious son of a bitch . you heard him , norman . all that `` someone went to a lot of trouble , try again '' bullshit . and `` impotent '' . where does he get off saying i 'm impotent ? he 's a fucking self-righteous , little prick .
not bad .
i am the son of annikin starkiller .
keep away , i 'm fine , i 'm fine .
you look great ! the uniform and everything !
but there was a lot of firing earlier ...
i 've got it blocked . i 'm all right .
what 's that ?
send out a boarding party . full assault gear .
was this trip really necessary ?
chewbacca , it 's time we showed them this isn 't the regulation f8-88 cargo trawler .
what are you saying ?
why ?
not if this tunnel deadends .
no , he smells something ... but we haven 't time to worry about it now .
you 're safe . we 've come to get you out of here ... just relax .
there 'll be time for that later . now let 's get out of here .
he 'll be well cared for .
send feed-back into the control sensors in that detention block .
bye ! write me ! i 'm gon na kill you guys !
what do i want with a scar ?
i didn 't see him !
what about it , diz ?
not enough , i guess .
we 're the old men , ace .
sir ... i guess i do , sir .
you got it bad .
ace of spades .
in addition to `` psychic dolt '' this test also proves i 'm unlucky ? two of hearts .
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom 's leg . he is going to go eat it .
i can 't ... but like i told you , it 's a number 's game . the federation needs all the pilots it can get ...
i 'm the guy who 's gon na teach you to fly this crate .
oh , i don 't know ... depends on who you are spending it with .

hut ... hut !
they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy .
i 'm on it !
a year at harvard and you 'll see this `` federal service '' is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves `` citizens '' and take airs for the rest of their lives .
a lot of my friends are doing federal service ...
wow ! santori and zegema beach , i 've always wanted to go there .
good luck . it 's not there anymore .
i 've made a mess of things . i 've been so stupid ...
you can never be sure .
the rodger young just burned up ...

nah , i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it 's too late ... gimmee the nuke .
looks like a bug was in his brain , sir .
v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator .
you may proceede .
v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information .
the carbon units are of no consequence ; v'ger will determine their purpose .
that is how v'ger will survive .
very well , mr. chekov , see to it . viewer off .
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator !
spock ... ! get a fix on his position !
mr. scott ... on my next signal .
no , admiral . i don 't think you are ; not one damned bit . i remember when you recommended me for this command . you told me how envious you were , and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again . well , sir , it looks like you found a way .
mister decker ; every minute brings that object nearer earth ! engineering ! stand by for warp drive .
sir , the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines . when they went into anti-matter imbalance , the phasers were automatically cut off .
yes , sir , i 'll do that .
no ... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile , mr. decker . cloud composition , mr. spock ?
that thing is twenty hours from earth . we know nothing about it yet .
forcefields , full remaining strength ... ! total reserve !
i 'm afraid our hand is pretty weak , captain . but it 's the only game in town .
this served the purpose .
v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe , thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions . to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension ; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator .
we have twenty-one minutes . captain , we can still save v'ger ... and ourselves .
i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species . you can assure him that 's true , can 't you ?
welcome aboard , lieutenant .
my oath of celibacy is on record captain . may i assume my duties ?
ten seconds ... .
accelerating to warp one , sir .
aye , sir .
that was the order , mr. sulu : clear the bridge .
starfleet , boost your matter gain ; we need more signal !
i want him here . sit down !
mr. decker , i will not provoke an attack , if that order isn 't clear to you ...
any reply from them ?
instruments fluctuating , captain . patterns unrecognizable .
get someone up here to take the navigator 's station ... ! engineering ... full emergency power !
i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information .
a life form of its own ; a conscious , living entity .
precisely .
helm ready , sir .
subspace frequencies are jammed by wormhole effect !
tractor beam remains constant ...
everybody makes their own fun . f'you don 't make it yourself , it ain 't fun , it 's entertainment .
i beg your pardon ?
it 's about a man who gets a second chance .
... oh ... oh . well . that 's very important .
you have to sign for it .
start back up the waterford sentinel . town newspaper . show you the plans ...
i 'm going to tell the truth .
... i 'm sure that people are upset ...
we 'll work it out ...
hold court , they have to , science lab , the high school .
hi .
uh -- why did we have to leave new hampshire ?
it 's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise .

and i 'm supposed to care .
tell me exactly how you 're different from three years ago ? the music sounds kind of the same from where i 'm sitting .
i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to break your concentration . i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb ...
you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once . that woman has nothing more to do with my children .
it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .
wowie . how wonderful !

i think my 'primo shit ' got left in my 'bellbottoms . '
... go to the park . in the worst way .
feeling the pressure ?
double .
it 's no biggie .
i know that .
oh , yeah ?
thanks , scoob .
it is when you love someone , and they don 't love you . and then you do something about it .
well then , when you get older you can do something about it .
i 'm serious ! what happens if he blows up the school ?
got a lot of homework ?
don 't worry , he doesn 't mean money .
i dunno .
how was the class ?
you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . anyway , i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral .
you 're absolutely right . the focus is on the college admissions process today .
i have a cousin . very big giver to the alumni fund .
ok !
take off your top .
i dunno . i 'd like to be good at something . it doesn 't have to be tv . i mean , it could be movies ... anything . i 'd be willing to direct .
just the soda , please . cooper heads down the hall . filmore watches him leave , sighs , then turns and smiles at the general manager :
who 's got matches ?
what happened !
you should listen your old man more often . he 's got principles .
yes , you should .
chemco 's been developing nerve gas ?
he 's in there ...
i 'm sure you 'll figure it out .
richter-we got a problem !
we 've ... been developing a product ... kz 70709 .
you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people .
all right , mister ambassador ! but you must treat general `` buck '' schmuck with the respect due him .
first of all , economic reasons . it was cheap . the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . it also seemed ideal in most other respects . it was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand .
mister president , are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ?
who the hell do you think you are , sir ? ? ?
what did you say , sir ?
well , that 's the funny part of it , too , sir . it doesn 't show a damned thing .
to peace on earth .
yes , sir . why don 't you stop the fighting , sir ?
peace on earth .
admiral buldike ?
knock it off will you , general ? crudley , find out what 's holding up that call !
well , just common sense , sir . thirty from thirty-four equals four , or my name 's not `` buck '' schmuck !

roger . one-three-eight .
maximum ecm !
lieutenant toejam , why don 't you help him ?

quentin , how 's your gear ?
no , thanks . i don 't drink . um , well , what 'd she say ? i mean , did she talk to him ?
yeah , when 's he coming ?

`` i sound like an idiot watching the parade i know there 's no tomorrow only the charade i am dead deep inside my head all the lies there 's no then only now i will love show me how ''
uh , eleven twenty-five .

everything 's fine . i 'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down .
it 's off ... i can 't take the fighting , the back-stabbing , the open hostility . we 're not acting like cheerleaders , we 're acting like a bunch of sorority girls !

but di , all this food reminds me of how much i want to teach our baby .
diane , there 's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins . now , if you guys were really friends , you 'd remind her to take these .
i 'll just ask the question myself ... `` is jack bartlett interested in me ? ''
di , it 's not your fault . we all wanted to do this - for you ... for ourselves .
oh - okay , we ain 't done with this ... those babies are gon na get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load ! we 're gon na learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals ! i 'm gon na visit my mom !
hee-hee-h-wait a minute . hold on , now . what do we do before a big game ?
i-i 'm sorry - can someone else please run the ouija board ? it 's creepy , it 's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior , jesus christ .
don 't martha-fucking-stewart me ! if you don 't like it - you try being a pregnant teen !
but you 're not married .
hey , i even took my parents ' foster kid money . phillipe 's gon na have to gather rice without pants this month .

it will never make house beautiful . i guess it 's o.k . for one night .
there are no locks anywhere in this house .
right with you .
what car ?
okay . and let 's have the car right outside .
softball .
it 's what we were warned about .
the naming of names is not necessary . just concentrate on her face . your shadow will do the rest .
yes , of course , it was foolish of me .
shut up , and get me a hacksaw .
it 's for your own protection .
you don 't like me ? you hate me ?
what do you feel about me ?
what wouldn 't last ? what 's the matter with you ?
i know what it is . she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle . inside there 's a silvery ring ...
you 'll be safe here . i 'll come back as soon as i have the power source .
yes .
she has hostages .
do you want to come to argo city ?
i 'll drink to that .
yeah .
well , lucy , it 's nice to see you 're feeling better . nice to meet you , jimmy .
-- planet . i mean , you were there . do you think it was natural , or like some people are claiming , supernatural ?
oh , sure .
as brave as my father . as wise .
can you create life ?
it was my fault . you aren 't old enough to use the wand . i shouldn 't have given it to you .
you sure ?
i dunno , but he 's gon na get creamed .
mr. danvers called . i 'll get a new one with the insurance money . b.f.d .
oh , yes . knocking . the pre-entry signal . i forgot .
i 'm linda lee .
here it is . oh ... of course . you 're the orphan . i 'm so sorry about your parents . we 'll try to make you happy here .
you 're going to pay a terrible price . the power of shadow is tricky . use it too much and it takes over .
such a shame . you ought to take better care of yourself .
we are in great danger . a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft .
it 's just one more crime you 'll have to pay for .
not yet .
for what ?
the phantom zone overlooks everywhere.. if you have the right tools .
going to try . didn 't say i could .
buddy , are we in trouble .
nope . never .
clark .
oh ... i came close once .
you know , i was just thinking , lana -- -- someone like you could do do really well in metropolis --
can i help ?
me too . that 's why i put this one up .
let me do it for you , mr. white .
oh . you 're going away .
mom and i do this all the time .
what !
exactly what i was about to ask about me .
at one o'clock in the morning ?
that what they call you ?
can 't wait , pal , can 't wait .
sister ! i 'm his sister !
well ... i guess they did get a little carried away .
i 'm in no rush . so what do you have in mind ?
bubba , does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking ... !
why don 't you hold your breath , instead ? maybe you 'll turn blue . on you that 'd be an improvement .
but how ? where 's it getting the power from ? ? ? !
why do i have to do this ?
hello .
somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan .
gus gorman , this is my psychic nutritionist .
well , webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system . how about ... hmmmm , someplace small ...
don 't cry , bubba .
like fish he is . i know enough about computers to put a phd to shame . come now , brother dear , you didn 't think i was going to let that little man run the show , did you ? gus gorman telling us what to do -- i 'd sooner kiss a pig !
don 't bet on it !
it 's your genius , pal ! you built a machine that can find anybody 's weak spot , just like you said .
do i detect a note of jealousy ?
that 's because you can hardly see through those things .
what ? ?
your place ? maybe i should change , maybe you should , too .
let 's get you inside . . . .
he knows where the eiffel tower is , olsen . you do , don 't you , kent ?
hey , don 't worry . you 'll be fine , just . . . well , don 't rush it .
luthor , you poisonous snake . . .
wait a minute , wait a minute , let 's talk a deal , superman . we can take a lunch on this --
he ran in fear from us . . .
brave young heroes . be nice to them , my dear . blow them a kiss .
and so i was yesterday . and the day before .
`` super-sucker . `` for once , lex luthor was right .
this is metropolis after hours ! this is what you 'll be writing about . c'mon , let 's dance .
actually , i had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom .
don 't worry , i 've got you .
don 't give up . this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis . now let 's get those knees up !
if you say so . here goes .
come early . the view is so romantic from my balcony .
oh . . . right . . . i 'll be back in a flash .
clark . . . !
let 's sit down . they walk to the table . lois calls out to the balcony .
no mind , it 's only antique irish linen .
clark , it 's lois . this is the fourth message . i 've left . . . where are you ?
well , i 'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because i had a visit from a very good nurse .
if my plan works , gentlemen , i 'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate . . . a number with a lot of zeros after it .
i 'm sorry .
absolutely !
n-no ... i mean ... you bet .
forget it , princess . clark is the world 's oldest boy scout trustworthy , loyal , obedient , helpful ... and i don 't remember the rest , but he 's them too . and i promise , he 's not interested in anyone like you .
. . . and very nave !
superman gets mail here ?
something . . . wonderful .
lenny , , you pathetic product of the public school system . your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman !
quiet ! you 'll make him self-conscious .
i must have miscalculated . how . . .
get the box , nephew .
he 's . . . beautiful . perfect .
you 're just an experiment , freako !
good . let 's hope he stays that way .
my nephew , leonard . he worships me . let 's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who 's about to finish last .
i made you , and i can destroy you .
i am master now .
you 've broken all the laws of man , luthor . and now you 've broken the laws of nature ! . . . i assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles i hurled into the sun !
no , no , listen . i escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of superman .
still having delusions , lex luthor ?
right , good . tell you what , we 'll wait right here . till you get back .
high school physics , luthor . while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun , it must have been his source of energy .
no . . . it 's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil .
we 're running out of smoke .
and stop interrupting . his is the big scene . your finest hour ! you rose to the challenge , baby ! and you lost . that 's the best part !
anyway , we kent 's don 't like showoffs , ain 't that so ? a body 's got to be humble even if he knows that he 's better'n his neighbors .
north . it 's north
hey , you 're getting a better class of people in your office these days , boss .
not really , no .
what about dinner ? i have to worry about the crime of the century , that 's all . y'know ? am i supposed to worry about what 's in the refrigerator , too ? what 's in it ?
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen. ,
i will as soon as i get the sand out of my nose .
lex is going bye-bye .
if you persist , you leave us no choice .
neither my wife nor i will attempt to leave krypton .
on the salary he pays me , i can 't make my rent without it .
all of us .
okay , but ... why ? no offense .
not a chance . it 's too nice a night .
pink .
yessir . just what you wanted .
ah , dear simple otis . albert explain it to him .
for the first time today , superman i must tell you that you 're wrong . but how could you know that - oh , well . i guess i could tell you now . y'see , actually ... but this conversation is becoming rather dry , isn 't it .
alison jones .
it turns to steaming piss .
okay .
well , sam , i might as well tell you the truth . it 's this lawsuit you 've gotten yourself all involved with . i want you to drop the damned thing .
no . it should be dry by now .
when the game 's over , i guess .
what 's that , dolores ?
yes . abbot understands these things .
hi , dolores .
a cup of tea would be nice . would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes , mrs. otto ? i want to talk to you .
how long has dolores been driving that bus , mr. otto ? how many times has she steered clear of danger ? what went wrong that morning ?
that 's what he said .
what do you want me to do for you , mr. stephens ?
was the bus on time ?
i object to that form of question . note that .
did there come a time when the bus turned off staples mill road onto
and what was the weather like at this time ?
i ... i just need to know what state you 're in so i know ... how to talk to you ... how to act ...
yes . i can hear you breathing too .
i love you , zoe . i 'll be there soon , and i 'll take care of you . no matter what happens . i 'll take care of you .
i remember the bus swerved , it just suddenly swerved to the right , and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road , and then it went over the embankment there , and everyone was screaming and everything . and that 's all . i guess i was unconscious after that . that 's all . then i was in the hospital .
don 't even try to remember .
oh . i better get some spackle .
yeah , right .
you don 't know that .
hitler !
the next time you want information , falco , don 't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man !
we 're on our way there now ...
your nephew doesn 't want a drink .
and with ten percent of his future , you 're great , too , frank .
robard 's my client . i did it for him and his club , not your boys .
give me a chance --
ten 'll get you fifty you 're playing hookey from a padded cell !
no , i 'm not . i 'm not !
history repeats itself . everything that happened to alan leslie ... began with a smear like this ...
but that wasn 't your fault , dear , what happened to leslie . i 've told you that a million times ...
a man couldn 't ask for a squarer shake . let me have billy van cleve ... don 't ever tell anyone , susie , how i 'm tied to your apron strings ... billy ! j.j. ! what 's this about that boy ? what boy ? where are we , lug , in a drawing room comedy ? you 're brain is warming up , sweetheart - yeah , dallas ! ... no , don 't explain your point of view , but ...
sometimes i think all men are fools ! ...
susan ! ...
yes , the justice , that 's right . but i think you had it in the column .
i have a message from your sister .
sure you can if you want to , and i know you 'll want to ... by the way , what 's your beef against little sidney ?
is that why you were romancing her , you mutt ! let 's call it quits , my dear . i 'd like it fine if you found another home . that means the front door is open ! pack your things , rent a moving van and git ! and as for marriage , let me hit you with a few choice facts : you aren 't ready for marriage ! you 're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men !
i call him the boy with the ice cream face !
he 's leaving early . after this `` set '' . he 'll be out in a couple of minutes ...
let 's wait till christmas - it 's more legitimate then .
no . that 's what i mean - i 'm being fired for what i didn 't do .
that 's what i 'm thinking , rita . maybe ...
can you be there by two-thirty ?
hello .

i hate to see you like this --
yes .

good ! we 're all off to utica , so excuse me , mr. frannis-on-the- portisan .
you tell him , i stutter !
i wasn 't looking for a brawl . i came to bring him a present . wan na bite to eat ?
who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops , like a trained poodle ?
frankly , yes , to my surprise . he thinks he 's very gifted - those boys 'll go a big mile , he thinks .
why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !
yeah . a coincidence you should run into the very man you 've been ducking all week ! this is my press agent , joan .
that was two months ago . take your hand out of my pocket , thief !
i 'm telling him in the morning after breakfast .
steve , stop it please ...
i 'm sorry , baby . this thing is just kicking my ass . i thought we had it with this one ...
shut up ! shut up ! ! motherfucker ! it 's all your fault ! it 's your fault ! !
no . only an object of equal size .
it can 't form complex machines . guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts . it doesn 't work that way . but it can form solid metal shapes .
you told me to .
of course . i 'm a terminator .

a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell .

take your kids . go to a hotel . right now . don 't pack . let 's go .
i don 't know .
but i promised your mother .
they 're trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories . who really owns what ? that 's colonel dymshitz , on the far side .
yes . what was the orchestra 's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler 's birthday ?
that 's why he didn 't get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he couldn 't answer . why didn 't he go and direct in america , like that italian , toscanini .
shut the door , emmi . sit down , emmi . we 're going to keep him waiting , too .
i 'll tell you , then . the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself . listen to it . they listen . did they pick little k 's recording ? did they pick some other conductor ? no , they picked you , and why ? because you represented them so beautifully . when the devil died , they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march . you were everything to them .
so . you wanted to see me .
of course . you , too . like everyone else in this goddamn country .
no . but that 's why we hated him . we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn 't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us . he didn 't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad . he got everything from them , everything . he was filthier than any of us party members .
his private life ?
you 're late .
all .
i thought you did .
no . but you will . it 's very important that you live .
caught one ? you mean you got shot ?
why ?
fuck you ! let go of me !
kyle ...
you 're not supposed to .
most official records were lost in the war . the computer knew almost nothing about connor 's mother . her name . where she lived , just the city . no scanner pictures . the terminator was just being systematic .
suspect westbound on olympic . grey sedan . has hostage , repeat ...
you could . but , if i leave without your signature , this agreement begins to disintegrate ; benefits shrink , options narrow , compensations shrivel .
then , you kiss his ass .
a bad month . you did the exact same thing to me last week .
don 't explain . fuck off . goodbye .
i don 't think he 's breathing .
hold on ... they want your driver 's license number .
what ... is ... happening ... ?
i don 't understand why they 're getting you involved .
never mind .
i think not .
come here ...
nicholas ...
no cops . i 've got a warrant out . mail fraud . they 'll take me in , but you won 't be able to prove anything else .
who the fuck cares ?
call them , tell them to get the boss up here . tell them i 'll kill you ...
baby , they were all over the house with metal detectors . they switched your gun with a look-alike , rigged barrel , loaded with blanks . pop-gun .
yes .
they were my husband 's . my late husband ... may he rest in peace .
have we met ?
sam ... thank you .
it 's not victorian , everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was victorian . this is gothic , this is english craftsman , this is romanesque . this is ... insane . who lives here ?
who 's watts ?
i did okay .
greetings .
i thought it best to be isolated , to be in a location with a definite sense of history , and i wanted to make sure that it wasn 't so pleasant you 'd all sleep too easily . you 'll be taking a variety of tests , none of them harmful , and you 've got the house , the grounds , and each other to keep you company .
there 's a carriage house around back .
just stay there , nell !
watts . those were his keys nell found . his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to . i think he 's here .
he must have left . didn 't like the looks of the place or something .
where in the hell can she be .
come on malcolm , it 's only seven ohms , it 's nothing , it 's like a joy buzzer ! and it 's not about the pain , it 's about the interference with concentration ...
yes , because someone was always keeping me awake . ever since i was little . that was my job . i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long , and she woke up all the time . and after she died , well , it 's been a few months , but i still , i still wake up , it 's ... a habit . i know we 've only known each other a couple of hours , but i 'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this . i 'm really happy to be here with you .
and they 're all locked together in here ... and he won 't let go of them !
nell . you will come here now .
nothing , if you leave right now . there 's a war going on all around us . don 't get in the way , please .
no , but nell 's been here longer than i have .
every day . basically we 'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening .
good morning , theo . luke .
how could you do this to people ?
nell , what do we do ?
that 's a good question . what is it about fences ? sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable . why would that be ?
mrs. dudley 'll be waiting for you .
no one will come any nearer than that .
you 're okay .
you know it wasn 't a joke , theo .
i guess . oh , your hair ! it looks good .
two sets . i don 't know . maybe they 're not even his .
me too . although i learned one thing about you , that you don 't know about yourself . you can be a pretty decent bitch .
just had to be sure .
then let 's go get you one .
i 'm a gracious host .
don 't have time for a lot of paperwork , y'know . just popped over on a quick visit .
no , but i know what he means .
i 'd rather be with him than without him . i don 't want to be found dead in l.a .
try calling me again .
well , i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me . some sort of pop music producer , wasn 't it .
too bleeding true , 'n ' it .
you 're a reluctant traveller , then .
lem me break .
no trouble .
it 's ok , i guess . no , i don 't really . i 'm not big on music , ordinarily .
that 's what he keeps telling me .
but i do appreciate it , mr crane ...
uh-huh .
ok. take your coat , ann ?
no , dave , i wasn 't .
my wife and i had not ... performed the sex act in many years .
i didn 't say a word .
what happened to you ?
you don 't have to tell me anything .
he and doris ... were having an affair .
i ... just knew . a husband knows .
... well , he got his mistrial , but the well had run dry . there was nothing left to mortgage ; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway ...
well , there 's lloyd garroway in san francisco . probity -- you know , no one ever said anything iffy about lloyd garroway . conservative . jury might like that . might like that here .
i 'm ok , walter , thanks .
oh , no . that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven .
sorry , i just didn 't remember .
he said ok. is that what he said ?
great .
the claws are sharp ... i must have cut myself . better move these crates to the secure storage area where they 'll be safe .
where 's the head ?
correct .
this door 's locked . try shooting the hinges off .
the sub-basement , huh ? great idea .
may i see that ?
the virus itself might have positive applications . they 'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made . greg isn 't joining us ?
you 're asking me ? i don 't even know how to load this thing .
oh shit .
i 'd say we 're in its home .
don 't stop now .
chicken . this is a great short cut .
don 't be a wuss . come on .
like this .
keep the animal quiet .
it 's not mammalian , that 's for sure . i think it 's reptilian .
it 's reptilian .
what kind of hormones ?
all right . if you 're positive .
no . i think i 'm hallucinating .
we have the fibers . don 't you see ? the creature is hungry . it wants the hormones in these plants . it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what 's in these fibers . we 're just a poor substitute . to make it stop hunting , we have to give it what it wants .
unlock one of the other storage rooms . we 're going upstairs . we 'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here .
listen to me , pendergast . mbwun 's dna is part homo sapien . in primates , the eye is a direct path to the brain ! if you get a clean shot , there 's only one place you can kill it . shoot it in the eye !
i 'm in town on a case . dropped by to see vince and we thought we 'd see the new display .
he gave it back to his father .
i think i 've studied enough .
i ... i can 't .
they 're ... perfect . thank you .
i still want to look over a couple of things .
i bet you did .
i 'm sure they 're just exaggerating .
do something ...
you 're not supposed to talk about it ? who told you that ?
me ?
yes .
there are complications .
yeah , i had an appointment for a pelvic examination .
no . don 't bother .
show you right on a map .
yeah , i did .
do you ?
something sweet .
nice try , mulder .
thirteen fifty nine , thirteen fifty eight , thirteen fifty seven ...
it looks pretty green for this climate .
this is great . this is fitting .
i have no idea .
for the purpose of what ?
yes you can . you 're going to make it , scully .
thank you .
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it : those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids . your father arranged for your sister 's abduction . he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program , so that she would survive . as a clone . he had different hopes for you . that you would uncover the truth about the project . that you would stop it . that you would fight the future .
driver .
well , without a cure for the virus , we 're nothing more than digestives anyway .
okay .
just graduated law school . single mom . had a two-year-old daughter .
they took care of that , thank you , henry .
i think that 's the whole point .
she 's bringing stargher into hers .
sometime yesterday morning .
stargher is in custody . the functional equivalent of being under arrest . normally , we 'd mirandize him , and if he didn 't lawyer up , we 'd interrogate him . but because of his condition , he doesn 't have the capacity to waive those rights .
that was with edward . she 's accustomed to his world . stargher 's mind is unfamiliar territory . she 's `` lost . '' someone has to go in . remind her what 's really happening . and get her out . until then , she 's at his mercy .
no .
grandparents . live over in davis .
gentlemen , i believe an albino dog is rare indeed .
she remembers because it was her `` dream truck . '' wanted one just like it .
considering where i 've been ...
i was talking to another friend of harry 's . a baron kurtz - do you know him ?
that was the man that brought me some money when harry died . he said harry had been anxious at the last moment .
i was told there were only two men there .
dr. winkel .
need we go through it all again ?
just another part i 've got to learn .
oh , we didn 't make much sense . drank too much . once he tried ...
yes .
well , don 't preach wisdom to me . you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners .
hide ? can 't a fellow have a drink ?
why should he help me like that ? the russians will only make trouble for him .
it 's true then ?
what did you say ? i 'm sorry ...
poor harry , i wish he was dead , he would be safe from all of you then .
i don 't ...
no , not yet .
once in a while .
it wasn 't petrol .
well , you could say that murder was part ...
calloway .
a bruised lip .
are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder ?
calloway , you haven 't shown me one shred of evidence .
i 'm not asking you to .
i 'll do what i can , if she 'll let me .
take him to sacher 's .
no , no . leave them for a while .
oh , mr. martins ...
listen , mr. martins , if you 'd agree to be our guest , we 'd be delighted to have you .
certainly .
good evening mr. crabbin .
of course , of course , of course .
it 's good to see you , holly .
i told the police .
you wouldn 't do anything .
do you know , i don 't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things ... victims ?
tension ? kurtz suspense .
but he said he died instantaneously .
what 's the name of this girl ?
i understand ...
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue .
not necessarily .
why no , mr. martins .
i 'm sorry . i can 't lend you any money .
here .
just take it , ok .
yeah , ok . forget it . we won 't tell anyone .
you can swim ?
what are you doing here , i thought you were a nazi .
then i won 't bring you ... .
that 's stupid . why would they ?
yes , i am . basically i am .
no .
judaism doesn 't even need god . you have the torah , the law . that 's your fucking god ... . the book 's closed .
it 's all you talk about . jewish , jewish , jewish . nobody talks about it that much except the jews .
do they ?
why don 't you come visit , we 'll have a rematch .
i 'll go look ... .
there 's a bomb here . it 's going to go off at seven-thirty .
the mother .
what ... ?
no , it 's weird , man . nobody knows where he went .
it 'll be enough if we use it right . okay , the service 'll go about another hour . say an hour for the janitors , then one more just to be safe ... we 'll go in at midnight .
shut up ...
the nazi 's killing his kid . he could 've jumped the guy . he could 've gouged his eyes out , grabbed the bayonet and gutted him ... . what would you have done if they were killing your son ?
... we have nothing to learn from these people . they should learn from us .
i was just trying to make a point . if --
... maybe , if jacques will let me fix up the place a little .
very much , i think . but , there 's going to be a problem .
i don 't have the strength to fight off la mamma ... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier .
i think i 'll have a coffee .
italy !
the fool was asleep ! if i weren 't around , he 'd already be dead ! ! ! is that who you want to live with ?
i 'm meditating , can 't you see ? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down . i can take a five minute nap , can 't i ?
enzo ...
because pasta should be eaten `` al dente '' . so the trinket will just have to wait a bit .
driving isn 't the problem , it 's remembering the right road .
long enough to die . listen , if you really want to die , that 's your problem , but don 't do it under my nose , okay ?
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo . i work for an insurance company . so , i decided to take a few days off . i don 't know this island at all . it really is gorgeous .
... okay . i 'll try .
it 's too loud for me .
... the way she moves .
uh ... yes , of course !
you 'll understand .
i saw how it has to be .
then you shouldn 't eat everyday , jacques .
no .
... sally ?
haven 't you been listening ?
don 't be a jerk . there 's no such thing as love at first sight .
coffee might be nice .
let him sleep .
i love her sir . if i don 't help you , i won 't be able to make her my wife . mohammed ali paula abdul rahim has agreed to come with me to the north pole on a rescue mission .
he 's ... he 's very nice . but mrs . carver , the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands . please , you have to help me .
i don 't think i could eat another latke if you paid me .
oh , she said that , did she ? what else did mommy dearest have to say ?
i can see . and you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us .
mom , stop with this already . of course i love you . you 're my mother .
mom , why don 't you put that cat out of its misery ?
well i 'm just glad you 're safe bubba shaina , and eating by your mother for shabos .
she said to remind you that you 're having shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the manischewitz .
now this might get a bit technical , but try and stay with me . using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators , called the internet , i can access surveillance maps , villian biographical information , and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter .
but wait , there 's more . with a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface , commonly referred to as a mouse , i can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail .
the hebrew hammer ! you 're alive .
whoa , whoa there . c'mon mordechai , is this any way to treat an old family friend ? let 's cut out all the unpleasantness . i admit , i went way overboard with the whole hanukkah thing . let me make it up to you . how about a peace offering ? girls .
in fact , he 's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling christmas this year .
while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems , i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive , jewish pride weakening substance on the planet . i bought the entire plant .
worse .
what are we gon na do ? he 's got us on the ropes .
resting ?
why not ?
that depends . how much money has he ?
i don 't know -
yes , i was drunk , mr. manning .
you found the leopard !
go on -
i suppose so . i suppose it will be different for us , too when everyone knows . then we will be just like other people . but these last weeks will always be our secret a lovely secret to remember all our lives .
i know . i know . you 've got the talent . i got the breaks .
i want to ask you something .
i can understand about the cat killing the first girl . charlie how come told me . all that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything . last night there was nothing to disturb it . just a little girl alone in a cemetery .
charlie likes his leopard .
just barely possible - - yes .
various reasons . but i can 't see why you 'd be interested in the rather dusty career of william galbraith teacher , naturalist , curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself .
miss walker -- i didn 't expect anyone
i am not interested in what somebody else thinks . you being me facts and i 'll act on them .
yes . and i am taking it to headquarters for examination .
offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit ? no . i 'm in office to protect the taxpayers money not throw it way . come on , charlie .
the red dress ? no . my black one . then i 'll be just like him .
don 't be soft .
and i suppose you don 't feel bad !
and not a sign of the leopard ?
he 's a nice guy . vie ought to keep in touch with him .
robles says it looks that way . belmonte had already been there and left . they only missed each other by a few minutes .
you . us .
we will
dial o-o-o on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink , sir .
last night you upset my sleep . tonight my social life . we have two minutes . my dinner guests are waiting .
you do want me to keep the job , dont you , mrs de moraes ?
uh ... wait a moment , mrs de moraes ...
no !
you wouldnt understand .
the dead can wait .
not in america , sir . you must be from europe . so , black coffee and a couple of crescents .
i dont smoke . if you could get to the point ...
im fine standing , thank you .
come on , mr lombard . you tailed your man all the way here from europe . you told me you knew where to find him , remember ? or didnt i hear you right ?
burn the passport and keep the money . think of it as a donation to the cause ...
its up to you whether they walk or not .
huh ! and they say charitys only rewarded in heaven ... hallelujah ... christ ...
jee ... fuck ... youre fucking mad !
can i have the reception desk , please .
i certainly did , sir ...
oh yeah ! better be good and hurry away then ! who knows ? we might be being watched ! maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all , thats what they do to their employees , isnt it ? huh ! hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives . thanks for the lift !
bye bye , jane . and dont be naughty .
leonard . what my daughter is on about , mr lombard , is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian . you might as well know that ...
jah ...
maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me . come on , lets go ...
should i come back in five minutes ?
so ... pretend it 's not a game .
jeanne 's been badly injured ! she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat !
tremoille ... don 't . please ...
louis ... water and fresh straw !
so ... what am i supposed to do now ?
you listen to your voices , i listen to my heart .
it would not be the same without you .
i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things , but as for my revelations , i 've never told anyone except my king ... charles the seventh ... the one and only king of france .
you have nothing to regret ...
i -- i can 't jeanne ... i can 't hear your confession ... i 'm sorry ...
don 't look at the cost , look at what it brings . what is your last offer ?
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god , and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france .
orleans has held out for six months . i don 't suppose a few days will make much difference . take some rest .
no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier ? they don 't fight for causes these days . they fight for money . who 's going to pay them ?
we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace . if they refuse , we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles .
me too ...
i don 't think . i leave that to god . i 'm nothing in all this , i 'm just the messenger .
that 's different ... i mean ... we were fighting for a ... for a cause !
they will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that .
we still believe in you , jeanne . if it were up to me , i 'd chase every goddamn englishman into the ocean . but it 's not up to us anymore -- it 's up to the king ...
playing ...
i -- i -- i ...
i am that i am . you don 't like my face ? maybe you prefer this one ...
oh yes , i play with them ... lots ...
who wants me to stop ?
it 's like this ... i ... we ... all of them .
wladek , please .
just over a year .
let 's find out .
how will we sleep ?
american jews , and there 's lots of them , what have they done for us ? what do they think they 're doing ? people here are dying , haven 't got a bite to eat . the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany !
what 's happened ?
what 's the matter with you all ? have you lost your sense of humour ?
warsaw 's not the only radio station .
it certainly was .
you 're out , aren 't you ?
hungry .
there are always notices going up .
since last night . i was pleased to see you .
don 't thank me . thank god . it 's his will that we should survive . well . that 's what we have to believe .
certainly , there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent .
yes , it 's unholy .
nothing just yet
i 'm sorry , i can 't do that . i don 't have the time . goodbye
what happened ?
it must come .
tomorrow .
hah , you 're very cunning ada , but i 've seen through you , i 'm not going to lose the land this way . wait here !
i don 't have to . you 'll be bustin ' in on the chief of police just up the hall .
hell no , i just cut into him . i woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes .
coupla days ago . i 'm workin ' a big one with gondorff on the north side .
no . never saw him before . he 's a dick , though .
aw , i got a brother down in k.c. , runs a freight outlet . i can go halfsies with 'em ! it ain 't too exciting , but it 's mostly legal .
we 'll be waitin ' .
i did . that stuff i gave him was counterfeit . they 'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it .
yeh , luther said you could teach me something . i already know how to drink .
neither are we .
let him wait .
if we ever get to it .
i thought i 'd lost him .
we 'll give him the hook on the train , and play him here . you think i can get in that poker game , eddie ?
that 's what i like about these guys , j.j ... they always got protection against things we 'd never do to 'em .
lonnegan .
what ! don 't give me that crap you little weenie . how do i know you ain 't gon na take a powder . you come to a game like this , you bring your money .
sixty-five .
you know me . i 'm just like you ... it 's two in the morning and i don 't know nobody .
no . they 're just the only ones we know of .
give 'em a little time .
we 'll get it , and if we can 't , we 'll just make it up . grand larceny , extortion . counterfeiting , anything you want .
sit down and shut up , will ya . try not to live up to all my expectations . we were told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker .
no .
look -- those are the first metals that came through .
it 's all right .
i can 't find him . i 've tried everything . i thought you might know .
do you know where he 's living ? oh ... . well , at least i 'm glad he 's all right . thank you for calling . goodbye .
nonsense ! she got at she deserved .
thanks ... we 're taking your cab .
what do you mean ?
man to man , i 'm not .
-- was wynant 's .
looks like he planned , something . he shut up his apartment and his shop .
i guess all the suspects are here .
so i see .
yes ?
that 's all right .
so did we . i mean , sherlock here .
i left instructions with julia . she 'll get it from you . goodbye .
slim .
what about it , tanner . isn 't that the truth ?
that 's not for you to decide . everybody 's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- the police will want his description . is this a picture of him ?
i 've got some very important news - i 've seen wynant .
i hope you won 't let this news spoil your dinner . nice food , isn 't it ?
we need ice .
too bad you didn 't bring your whip .
there 's nothing i can do to help her .
that 's great . i was afraid i 'd have to go to sleep .
he 'll be here . give him time to get his trousers on . where 's asta ? asta ! asta !
that 's not true . he never came near my tabloids . that 's one thing i always protect ... my tabloids .
yes . it 's asta 's christmas present .
catch me letting you go alone !
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin . it often bothered him . so i looked for it and i found it . gim me .
thank you , mrs. charles .
i 'm afraid you 're lying , mimi . you see , i really did see wynant last night .
let 's see ... where was i ? oh , yes . he went to find the man . that man was desperate ! he knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face , he took the only way out . he killed wynant . it 's terrible to tell you this way but your father 's dead , dorothy .
after our hero had killed wynant , he got a brilliant idea . he realized that he and julia could still collect money . wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay , signing wynant 's name , so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia . he even telephoned macaulay -- do you remember ? ... . the first day that you came to see me ... he telephoned that he was in town ?
no ... no .
y-yes .
not up to us . up to the iraqis . all they have to do is get out of kuwait .
there you go , jaeger . just find the buried treasure , and you 're a millionaire .
oh , god .
no , please , not again .
we 're going to keep driving .
him getting us stranded out here doesn 't do much good either .
the soldiers are going to kill those people !
we can fight . that 's what we 're here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the shi'ites , and the khurds .
let me see the map .
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i don 't think it 'll be too hard to --
so we wait .
i told you : when i straighten someone out they stay straightened . this is how it works : nobody touches the gold . except when we 're on the move and someone 's carrying it , nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it . agreed ?
tell me something , wes . are you crazy , greedy , or just stupid ? jaeger says you 're crazy .
wait . wait .
we go , we get rich , we go home . it 's that easy .
millionaires , man .
we leave it .
epps , my leg is falling asleep .
you 're not going to let me die , are you ! ? don 't let me die !
just figure it 's my map , i ought to hang on to it .
what are they doing here ?
the shi'ites are on our side ? i didn 't know that .
right now i wouldn 't be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns .
it 's giving .
it stays as it is . we 're halfway home now . let 's not blow it by people getting ideas .
is it all right if i stand up ?
if we can find the hummer , or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay . we 've got enough water for that . but we won 't make another day otherwise .
it 's got to be going better than this..
me ? i say you don 't have enough brains to be stupid .
we go this way .
he 'll slow down .
i could use some recon photos too .
i could .
it 's a container . break the seal .
yes !
hell , we 'll just buy our way out .
oh , no .
you know what i 'm doing with my half ?
anytime you want to do something about it just let --
i know you 're a pussy . i know that .
just seems weird they didn 't chase us .
i think we found something .
he 's a soldier . he doesn 't need a weapon . he 's got rocks . he 's got bare hands .
he lived through that ?
the white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler . that 's why they wear them .
probably shot a few . scattered the rest . murderers .
what 's the matter with you ?
i didn 't . you asked me about the card . you 're going to get us into trouble .
don 't let them separate us .
it seems i am destined to endure many frustrations ... .but at the same time i am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction , and that even if it remains incomplete , my search has not been in vain .
we can not stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed . you can work with us . an organized plan of escape must be devised first . could you see anything ? you want to leave . you 're not like them . you must have left something , or someone .
impossible !
ask him about the air . he looks out of breath .
it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind , but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design .
no , look ! three degrees from the central azimuth .
you have nothing to fear . you 're safe again .
all the insides are gone !
i 'm only trying to help you .
i thought of something ... ..
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred .
mike reilly .
industrial wood oil . separately , any one of these things could lead in several directions , but together ...
`til we get a better lead .
you got it .
right .
he has a timer going as back-up , in case we got a hold of the remote . okay ... first , run your fingers along the edges , feel for a sensor .
don 't touch that .
easy , guys .
we 're a bit busy at the moment , i 'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we 're still alive .
hey , i 'm next .
hope you don 't mind , captain , might help us catch these guys that much sooner . coming ?
let 's get something straight . we 're doing you a favor . you 're not exactly a guy we want around explosives .
let 's face it , we all knew it would happen sooner or later . the guy who can build a mousetrap that 's better than we are ...
what ? nobody , i-
we can 't take the chance . ring down to the bomb squad . i want them on alert .
can it , pluchinsky . and shove some cotton up your nose .
what kind of bomb was it ?
time for bed , kiddos . say goodnight .
i don 't know ...
scorch marks ... looks like they used silly putty .
awright ! how bout you , glass , how 's that chip shaking ?
you mean you just -- ? ... you keep a record of ... matches ?
my first undercover assignment . i got ta look good , right ?
he 's married , he don 't even know what a lesbian is .
i 'll do it .
where did you find it ?
erect in sweater , arms folded .
he bows , goes . door shuts behind him .
well , he knocked at the door . you see , i was expecting two -- uh -- two business associates .
i said , `` come in . '' and there he was . a fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns . he said , `` good evening . i 'm the doctor . '' i said , `` doctor ? '' he said , `` yes , the doctor . i came to see about your tonsils . ''
lily !
the pleasure is mine , madame .
no . what is it ? tell me .
please !
thank you , rose .
i 'm sorry that i didn 't build you a stronger ship , young rose .
and to you , mr. andrews .
you are , lewis . you rolling ?
how it 's going ? it 's going like a first date in prison , whattaya think ? !
alright . you have my attention , rose . can you tell me who the woman in the picture is ?
this is ridiculous , lovejoy . find her .
she knows .
there 's no need for language , mr. hockley . go back and turn the heater on in my room , so it won 't be too cold when we get back .
rose is displeased . mmm ... what to do ?
diamond . yes it is . 56 carats .
maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on .
rose ... your mother and i have been looking for you --
jewels are precious . goodbye , mr. hockley .
no caviar for me , thanks . never did like it much .
probably best . it 'll be all business and politics , that sort of thing . wouldn 't interest you . good of you to come .
porca madonna ! ! yeeaaaaa ! ! !
smell ice , can you ? bleedin ' christ !
ain 't you boys ever rowed before ? here , gim me those oars . i 'll show ya how it 's done .
aw knock it off , yer scarin ' me . come on girls , grab your oars . let 's go . well come on !
it would hurt . i 'm not saying it wouldn 't . to be honest i 'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold .
well , they didn 't think too much of 'em in paree .
well , they didn 't think too much of 'em in paree .
yup . that 's one of the great things about paris . lots of girls willing take their clothes off .
you 're still my best girl , cora .
just move with me . don 't think .
sssshh . come here .
zat is true , i am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions . hey ... monet !
a diamond . a very rare diamond , called the heart of the ocean .
he couldn 't have .
i didn 't . i just realized i already knew .
get in the boat , rose .
right .
excuse me .
charmed , i 'm sure .
goodbye , mother .
yes , yes -- the air -- -- i 'm getting plenty of air . miss marsh -- mrs. rosson .
sooner -- if you like . see you again , i hope .
why worry ? it was insured -- how about that swimming lesson i promised you ?
if i ever won a pot that large the boat would sink .
i 'll bet a couple of hundred .
fine -- i 'll be glad to .
sure ! excuse me .
i 'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em -- why , a high-school kid could take you saps -- and another thing -- lay off sally marsh . -- '' honest jack '' ! one look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets .
i 'll be there -- good-by .
decent ? i guess any guy could be decent -- if you were interested .
jimmy !
what 's the matter ?
i 'll watch for him , sir .
shortie , look !
think again --
i 'll go with you --
nervous . couldn 't sleep . feel like a nightcap ?
you keep out of this -- you admit you thought of killing him -- how were you going to do it ?
now that that 's settled , why not make the game a foursome ?
of course -- but -- there 's your cue -- hurry up --
no -- he 's probably one of the `` here 's how . '' take it easy -- the ocean 's pretty rough today --
oh , -- i was having so much fun i almost forgot --
good-night , folks .
looks lonesome -- bring him over here .
well , i helped my hand so i 'll have to see you .
let 's see if i can bring it back to life .
this is interesting -- why didn 't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night ?
he 's a swell person . he told me he 'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million .
do you think lother could have seen it ?
500 ? sly boots , must be a peach of a hand .
ed bailey , you look like you 're just ready to burst . well call me a fool but i guess i 'll just have to call . cover your ears , darling .
well i 'm not so go home .
oh , jesus , johnny ...
i know . just did what you had to . that banner and stuff , that 's just ike . don 't worry about it .
no ...
no ...
here it come : one-two-
say when .
yes , but there 's just something about him . something around the eyes , i don 't know , reminds me of ... me . no . i 'm sure of it , i hate him .
enough ? never .
perfect , wyatt . simply perfect .
you will or you won 't . don 't look to me . i 'm going to sleep .
felt his liver go on that last one . get him to a doctor or he 'll be dead in a couple hours .
no ...
what was that all about ?
i 'll pay you 500 each in advance and i 'll mount you on those .
i know . me neither .
yeah . or undertakers .
not so sure . somethin ' tells me it gets harder from here in . should 've held out for more money .
how is he ?
never even heard of anything like it .
then let 's make sure we get our money 's worth
fortuitous even .
wyatt ...
mattie , they 're here ! folks this is celia ann but you can call her mattie . or even mrs. earp if you prefer .
i think i 'll just lie down awhile
yeah , well , i swore a lot of things .
drop his horse .
so he can tell the story .
they 're wise by now . which is next , iron springs ? yeah , let 's try there , iron springs .
we 'll go around that way , come up on foot .
hey , wyatt , god damn it , i 'm serious !
lotta law around here . just met the sheriff .
i 'll be damned ...
just his style , morg . doesn 't mean anything .
fine . better .
that didn 't sound like thunder .
listen mister , i 'm getting ' tired-
jack ...
i know , i need a keeper .
easy , virge , they 're just tryin ' to egg us on .
bundle up , virge . cold out there .
bring up the tracking satellite . and get 007 out of there .
i can tell you 're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions , mr . bond . darling ! come here . i want you to meet my wife .
sidney , perhaps we should leave this to -
my guards are from south africa , mr . bond . this is their chance to get even with the formerly 'great ' britain . now both of you . put your hands on your heads , and step forward .
what about the gold ?
no , 007 . it 's just that i 've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - somehow the reality is never as ... satisfying as the fantasy .
nothing .
no ! he 's crazy - he 's insane . he hates everybody . he 's got these plans - you 've got to help me , james . i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry for everything . i know i was wrong - but you 've got to protect me . i know you still love -
one thing at a time . i 'll see you in twenty minutes . go .
not from forty feet .
not if you kill us first - unless that 's how you plan to leave muffy .
he tied one on .
no . but you can buy a drink for my friend , taro .
i hope so .
think about mom .
- the family jewels ?
no . i want sir elliot to keep them .
the only mistake is that they didn 't kill us in the elevator .
my father left me the business .
cleans dirt . let 's go .
it 's a lousy job , but - the only reason i stay is for the health benefits .
i didn 't say when i want to die -
of course . minister johnstone .
only what i read in the newspapers .
good luck on your mission , 007 .
tsi tien , professor wu .
good-day , miss winch . i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .
check it again . what about the global positioning satellite ? could there be something wrong with the signal ?
... i see .
excellent .
you come with me - you stay here .
get more men up there !
i should have hired this man . get somebody up there !
thank you sir ! thank you !
we will take her . you all stay here and watch dad .
what is it , noontime ?
i would like to finish reading this . what would i talk about ? i haven 't read this month 's almanac . i don 't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes . they pride themselves in making life hard and that 's not my cup of tea .
well , you look better than you did yesterday .
that is called a crab apple switch . it 's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i don 't know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk 's stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was emory . my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl 's room and he wouldn 't stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
it would be nice .
it 's healing now .
he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age .
he knows better . sunny , apologize to harry .
that 's awful generous of you . i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome .
it was slow . now it seems like everyone is having births at home .
it hasn 't been the years ; it 's been the men in her life .
i tell you , i feel like a ghost .
well , i don 't want to put you out .
i 'll be right there .
i already have , my dear .
i haven 't heard anyone mention swamp root since button-up shoes went out .
i want to hear what happened . my brother is a jackass and a damn fool . the both of you have been as scarce as hen 's teeth .
no , i haven 't seen him .
honey , i 'm sure he 's around . you 'll find him .
sure ! i 'll even let you drive .
bye , house .
let 's let molly open one .
well sure , look at him . he 's got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife .
it 's a long story , bo . i 'll explain later . here , catch this !
mm-hmmmmm .
alright , everyone . you 're clear to come up .
that wasn 't flying ! that was falling with style !
oh , yeah , tough guy ? !
go away .
sorry .
where is it ? i don 't see the --
you are the one that decided to climb into this --
oh , great , great . yeah , and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death .
still no word from star command . we 're not that far from the spaceport --
i 'll tell you what 's -- aaaah !
shield your eyes !
we 've got to get out of here ... now .
look out ! !
hold still , buzz !
not today !
we 're not aiming for the truck !
now buzz , what could andy possibly get that is worse than you ? !
oh , what ? ! ... what ? ! these are plastic . he can 't fly !
i can 't see a thing !
i got dibs on his hat !
how 'bout three out of five ?
he 's in the psycho 's bedroom !
patient is ... ... pre-e-epped .
have you been replaced ?
and i 'm from mattel . well , i 'm not actually from mattel , i 'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out . well , i don 't really understand the financials , but ...
oh , uh , mr. lightyear ? now i 'm curious . what does a space ranger actually do ?
he tortures toys -- just for fun .
who would 've thought he was capable of such atrocities ? !
alright ! that 's it !
nothing .
i was close to being scared that time .
hey , woody ! ? where 'd ya go ?
woody ? who 's up there with you ?
oh , i don 't like confrontations .
there aren 't any more ! that 's the whole barrel .
i can 't quite make out --
uh-oh .
just stay where you are , corporal ! don 't move , carl . you 'll blow up . i know you 're tired ! i know your leg is cramping , but you can 't move . do you hear me ?
sid ! ! !
what ? !
it 's busted .
got it .
uh-h-h-h ... nothing ! uh , nothing . i 'm sure andy was just a little excited , that 's all . too much cake and ice cream , i suppose . it 's just a mistake .
oh , shut up ! in a couple of days , everything will be just the way it was . they 'll see ... they 'll see . i 'm still andy 's favorite toy .
i knew you 'd come back , woody !
see ? it is buzz . now give back the lights , potato head .
slink ! hang on !
speak when you 're spoken to . he likes his women quiet .
he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf , but , his bite is worse than his bark , isn 't that so , old fellow ?
almighty jove in the shape of a swan .
storms ?
it 's all right , finn .
well , you know , he 's going to say about madrigal ... and salazar .
arnie , thank god .
i know i made things worse . i know that and i 'm sorry , but arnie i need something from you . something only you can help me with .
it 's the same . what happened to what they gave you ?
carl , i 'm running late . i 'm coming right now --
no , not yet .
that makes mom the czarina . i 'm a czarette . like anastasia .
somehow , i don 't see that happening .
fuck you . i wasn 't doing anything . you 're like the gestapo .
like i give a fuck .
he 's gon na fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
we got you on tape making the deal . we got you bragging about the quality . we got you bragging about your business . we got you .
who do you work for ?
i love my job . i love it . the next time i 'm having a bad day you got ta remind me of right now and i 'll get over it .
she 's your girlfriend . open it , talk about your kids .
yeah !
what are you ? a mouse ? get out of the car and do it . this is your chance .
when the dea gets into the narcotics business , then we 'll stay at the four seasons .
deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego . and we have a deal .
the police won 't find your car .
i feel like a traitor .
everybody has a weakness .
you want to help ? stay the fuck away from her .
right . now it 's used by somebody from the juarez cartel , one of his lieutenants ... who knows ? every damn day there 's birthday party . at first i thought they must have three hundred children , then i realized they 're taunting us . three miles away and we can 't touch them . ha , ha , ha .
you 'll never catch us , you flabby bastard . right , see , when i come back --
if everyone keeps their mouth shut , there 'll be no one going to jail .
aye , ok , fr . but the good times couldn 't last for ever .
too right it is . now look , have you got anything to eat , 'cos i 'm fucking lee marvin , by the way .
let 's face it , it could have been wonderful .
for four fucking grand ? one palm tree , a couple of rocks , and a sewage outflow .
not sorry enough for being a fat cunt .
well , he 's young and he 's healthy .
the pleasure was mine . best interview i 've ever been to . thanks .
sorry about last night -
clear enough , moneypenny . this should present no significant problem .
i don 't know , tommy . i don 't know if it 's ... normal .
he doubts me .
is there a problem , gentlemen ?
all right , we 're lost . but we 're making good time .
and we can 't see a thing . request you direct us to the coordinates .
estimating destination in 6.7 hours , present speed .
but , captain , we 're firing directly on your position .
i don 't have a clue .
if we could send a distress signal ...
put it on the veiwscreen , would you please ?
put it on the screen .
go , sulu .
i 'm flattered . twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me .
spock , i appreciate your concern , but if you don 't stop distracting me , i 'm liable to be one ...
are we leaving , captain ?
i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words .
perhaps i have , captain . perhaps i have .
we don 't have 1.2 hours .
let me do something .
the only problem is , it 's up there . we 're down here .
it must be all those marsh melons .
not possible . you were never alone .
sybok , listen to me . in order for this craft to enter the landing bay , enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam . to get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
i 'll take you to the bridge .
i 've done nothing . this is who they are . didn 't you know that ?
nah ... i decided ... i 've had enough of video games to last me a good long time . i feel like gettin ' into some real life ...
i 'm certainly not .
yes , okay , exactement !
no , nuh-uh , never in a million years !
not a chance .
you know anybody that 's got an army for rent , that 's fine ... but my , uh , user said to go take that sucker out . an ' let 's face it , the big ox isn 't gon na get any weaker . i feel like hittin ' him now , while i 'm good an ' mad . some nerve ... what does he care whether you guys get killed , long as he keeps rakin ' in quarters ?
no good ... they might block off the old chip . this way .
guess i took a wrong turn somewhere ...
let 's get some power here .
probably .
shhhhh .
tron ... ?
yeah , but i 'm remembering all kinds of stuff . like ... my user wants me to go after the mcp
come here .
touche , honey . yeah , i 've been doing a little hacking here . which i 've got every reason , as you well know ...
end of line .
we have to .
i have to find out what alan wants ... that comes first .
i had to ... in the games ...
then i owe you some thanks ...
simon ? ohmygod .
it is true ! he doesn 't know anything about me . he still thinks i 'm like ten years old or something . as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything 's fine . but it 's not fine . nothing 's fine .
dad . you just think you know everything , don 't you ?
it 's talkradio . you 're on the air .
yep . sleep fast .
albert gibson . three four nine nine one .
in her dreams .
nope . the art buys are in a separate ledger .
she could be moving money , guns . anything .
see , that 's the problem with terrorists . they 're really inconsiderate when it comes to people 's schedules .
stay on him .
that 's it . get 'im harry we 'll teach that little puke not to signal .
the purse is still at the house .
wait ! calm down , mrs. tasker . there is only one more question .
in her walkman . it 's the one thing i knew she 'd be taking .
but he 's not exactly ringing your bell lately , right ? i mean --
i 'd like that .
i agree .
that 's right . they want something ... dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you 're the one to see .
yeah . it was great .
i can 't , honey . i promised allison i 'd go shopping with her . sorry .
i don 't know anything about a faction . i just met simon ... or whatever his name is ... a couple of weeks ago . i barely know him .
you 're in a lot of trouble , mrs. tasker , so i suggest you cooperate . if we want to know the most intimate details of your life , you 'd better tell us .
no .
answer the question --
what ? oh , the flat tire ? yeah , i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there .
sure , hon .
i 'm not wearing any .
we must be in the florida keys . * . . the overseas highway * connects the islands to the mainland .
go down there and kill everybody , i guess .
dance ?
absolutely .
i always have a couple on the hook . you know . there 's one right now , i 've got her panting like a dog . it 's great .
red hot . her thighs steam .
hey , slow down you 're gon na miss the turn !
samir is just going to ask harry a few questions . see , we 're not even sure which agency harry works for . now , samir is absolutely first class , but on the other hand we have harry , here , who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years . so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist .
the same place . one o'clock . i have to go now . see you tomorrow . remember , i need you .
wait a minute -
you can 't have just one .
this is great , we got cable .
okee-dokee , doggie-daddy .

i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up .
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ...
i just got ta get somethin ' .
nope . i 'm not really a wine gal .
it is what i want . but i don 't want to spend the next ten years in jail . i don 't want you guys to go to jail . we don 't know what could be waiting for us up there . it 'll probably be just what it 's supposed to be . the only thing that 's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars . i 'm just looking at the downside .
me thinketh he doth protest too much .
nigger , i eat everything . i eat pussy . i eat the butt . i eat every motherfuckin ' thang .
take that shit somewhere else .
ask him if he got the letter .
every word of it .
for the very first time in my life . do you know what that 's like ?
it 'll get ya high .
i guess so . follow me .
i 'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up .
sure .
step inside .
whatta we gon na do ? he 's in an elevator .
naw . it don 't feel too good but it 's alright .
nigger , you lie like a big dog .
donowitz , he said .
i went to the surface and i collected specimens like i was told .
uh , i think so . in the mental hospital .
i don 't want your `` women , '' you brainless twit ! i want to be well !
well , sir , i don 't think the human mind was built to exist in two different ... whatever you call it ... '' dimensions . '' it 's stressful , you said it yourselves , it gets you confused . you don 't know what 's real and what 's not .
we 're going to think about it , cole . among ourselves . we 'll get back to you .
you don 't want to jeopardize that reduction , do you , cole ? have it taken away ?
cole , did you or did you not record that message ?
you 're still a little ... disoriented .
this is it , james ... what you 've been working for .
shut up !
i think it was ... i 'm sure it was 2nd street .
1989 . six years for you . there 's the sign ! right here !
you 're flushed . and you were moaning . i think you 're running a fever . what are you doing ?
i did him a favor . now come on .
i 've got one now .
you know dr. mason 's son , jeffrey mason , don 't you , james ? you met him in the county hospital six years ago .
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist .
i ... i ... we need cash , james .
they got your message , kathryn . they played it for me . it was a bad recording ... distorted . i didn 't recognize your voice .
on the walls -- they meant the animals when they said , `` we did it . ''
airports all look the same . maybe it 's ... james ! your moustache ! it 's slipping .
monkeys . twelve of them .
pulling out the tooth , man , that was nuts ! here , take this .
we 'll get to the spider later , mr. cole . right now , we want to know everything that you saw .
well , the guard woke me up . he told me i volunteered .
yes , sir .
that 's 'cause he 's dead .
there you go , sweet talking me again .
'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring . that 's when she started shooting . can 't blame her . the ring was all carlos left her when he died .
baby didn 't die . just froze off all it 's finger and toes . just a little fingerless , toeless boy now . but the husband ; he sees what the wife 's done , so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it . now she died .
john --
who the hell is this ! ?
nothing , jake . absolutely nothing .
if he says that 's what happened , jake , it must be true .
i told you . i knew it was there . didn 't i tell you ?
no .
just drive .
is this what it 's all about ? you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you ? forget it . you want to take my head off , mister , i won 't even try to stop you . i deserve it for being an idiot . but if you 're not , i think i 'll be on my way .
and tell her what ?
no .
stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of .
you stay away , jenny . i aim to mess him up , and that ain 't a thing for a woman to see .
that 's 'cause he 's dead .
i 'll give you a lift , son . too hot to be walking ... people die out here , y'know .
no !
i like darrell . he may be an idiot , but he 's my half brother . we own harlin 's together , yeah , that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out .
what are you talking about !
bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now .
no ! you get it !
what are you talking about ?
you think now that jake 's dead , there 's all that money there and i don 't need you anymore , and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and ... pop !
shit i 'm sorry ! ... you can 't believe the strain i 'm under . i 'm just under a lot of strain here .
the ticket is 30.55 .
i 'm sorry . it 's just ... you know ...
nothing , jake . absolutely nothing .
shhhh ! just like your mama , always scared of things ...
like you helped her , jake ?
stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of . i ain 't never taken no drugs , mister , and ...
you stay away , jenny . i aim to mess him up , and that ain 't a thing for a woman to see .
oh .
you use your sleeve .
jesus .
my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?

come on . keaton was a cop for four years . who else would know the taxi service
keaton always said : & quot ; i don 't believe in god , but i 'm afraid of him. & quot ; well i believe in god , and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze .
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran .
then prosecute . i will be very impressed to see if the district attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy . i would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged & quot ; faceless people in city hall & quot ; you mention .
frank galvin 's ... who 's calling please ? bishop brophy 's office ...
it 's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...
no . no . thank you . you go home .
that 's perfectly all right . i 'm kind of rushed . do you mind if we walk while we talk ?
what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party ... ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge ...
so what do you want me to do ? concannon 's going to try the case his way , i 'm going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he 's got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . i 'm going to win this case .
we got to talk .

thanks , franky .
i married into it .
no ... no , thanks . a bit early in the day for spirits . well , i guess that about covers everything , doesn 't it ? i never married ; i don 't see much of the `` old college gang '' ; i 'm a retired detective -- and you 're in the shipbuilding business . what 's on your mind , gavin ?
honest ?
no , it 's not right .
yes . yes , i do .
too late ... too late ... there 's no bringing her back .
you ... ... fell into the bay .
oh , that 's a lovely spot , isn 't it ? i 've never been inside . but it looks so lovely , driving past .
oh ! yes ! here !
no , thank you .
and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if i 'm mad ? that would explain it , wouldn 't it ?
all the time .
only this far .
i stood alone on the green , searching for something , and i started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , i was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and i fought to wake up ...
oh ?
now , judy , it isn 't anything to get --
bullshit it 's not accesory . i didn 't do shit . you call the cops , you explain it was an accident ...
that 's a horrible ugly comment . `` dead whore ? '' she 's a person !
she 's dead .
playing ?
they 're not on to us . i 'm gon na call boyd .
you fucking bastard !
i 'm not getting a ticket .
you don 't know what you 're doing .
why ?
you 're a lying deviant . what did you do ? !
sure , why not .
what happened ? oh my god ...
tomorrow . we are getting married tomorrow .
that 's the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
fine . don 't come crying to boyd . no sir .
left side .
prison communication systems . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
i can 't .
well we can definitely call the police . that 's an easy call . if we call the police ... what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... they ask us ... what happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , micheal ... your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ...
nobody knows .
what 's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl 's head through a toilet . that 's insane .
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . adam . your brother and i , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you ... ... are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .
you always were a jealous man .
no , the problem , as i recall , was the lack of blocking ...
suck my ass .
you will not screw this up .
micheal get a grip . what did you tell her ?
i 'm not sure .
what money ?
just go ahead and say what 's on your mind .
yup .
that 's what i 'm thinking .
yup .
you 'd like me to kill them ?
yes , yes .
smoking makes me feel ill ? it 's these filthy fag ends . i won 't mention in this company what 's upsetting you .
in twenty years the grass has invaded everything . there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor . i hardly ever go out .
no , but what a pity life is like that .
then it 's penance for you who are going to be a nun ; and for me , who am old , it 's death ...
whatever you like .
no , uncle , and now i 'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although i didn 't think so at first , you are really a good man .
you must be out of your mind . i 've been so happy these last few days -- now you 've spoiled it all .
go away ! leave me alone .
yes , sir . good night .
i have asked her but she 's ungrateful . sometimes i feel like hitting her . when i talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
what 's the matter ?
yes , sir .
it 's only that ... it 's all very odd , sir .
i didn 't want to do it , don jorge . they made me ...
why do you say that ? perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous .
what are you going to do ?
you 're happy , aren 't you !
that 's life . some people are brought together , others are separated . what can we do , if that 's the way it happens ?
if you free me , you 'll be a rich man ...
there 's plenty of money in this house . piles of it .
why did he kill himself ?
one shouldn 't be alone the whole time . i 'm not like him , am i ?
that 's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used .
i 've been expecting you ; i got a letter from the lawyer .
i 'm not like you , you have your wife .
don 't worry . nobody 's going to disturb you .
i 'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now , sit down and go on eating . and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock !
you little liar ! get out of here !
they shut all right now . and the blankets are ready .
this louse is looking for trouble .
but , miss ...
mother .
you are forgiven . goodbye .
don 't pay any attention to him . it 's very good .
ah ! pleased to meet you .
no , i don 't want to .
me ? what did i do ?
why wasn 't i told ?

if you can catch him .
what she 's going to do is get in my way .
you sonofabitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ?
i don 't set policy . you have the key ?
got it .
you 're ... such a wimp .
all my work is my finest .
of course you are .
what you need is a collar .
do me one favor if you shoot at anything , make sure i 'm nowhere near it .
maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him ...
i 'm still working on it .
how did you get your hand out ?
stop me .
this is my area of expertise .
nothing .
if you 're gon na do it , better do it now .
no ! grimes isn 't back . he 's only one part of sid . sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was . get a hold of yourself !
they 're going to fry me for it , anyway .
you knew the entire time ? can you give me one good reason why i shouldn 't kill you right now ?
lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had ...

you wouldn 't be here if it wasn 't true . it 's true , right ?
what 'd ya think ?
they caught him in the closet with a girlscout . side- effects of a pill ain 't gone trump that . you have to keep'em guessing for two weeks . you don 't have to cure cancer , pal , you just have to give them something more interesting than ...
okay , look , who 's takin ' the press conference today ?

wherever you like , lutece , 21 , the river cafe ... or maybe we can just drive around for a while . work up an appetite .
all right , bud ... let 's do it .

bud fox , i look at a hundred ideas a day . i choose one .
stick around ... larry , one of my `` gang '' -- bud fox .
but we don 't want to be greedy now , so let 's let him have it at $ 72 .

as far as touching things , yes . but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head- it won 't go away god - if i could just understand it .

wonderful - like a great release - he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him - the world is better without him

some -- but mostly lions , and tigers , and bears .
i 'd be clever as a gizzard --
a heart --
don 't cry -- you 'll rust yourself again !
well , you can 't . as for you , my fine friend -- you 're a victim of disorganized thinking . you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . you 're confusing courage with wisdom . back where i come from , we have men who are called heroes . once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . and they have no more courage than you have . but ! they have one thing that you haven 't got ! a medal ! therefore -- for meritorious ... .

elektra , its not too late . eight million people neednt die .
you are out of your league . shes working with renard .
how would you know ?
what do you think ?
yes . au revoir ...
thirty minutes maximum . of course , i assume we 'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order .
why , doctor . i did . he was a bad dog .
saw the world that night -- random , empty , hideous . god didn 't make it that way . we did . we make the world -- in our own image . what else can i illuminate ?
you mean afghanistan ? it won 't require my attention . what i 'm doing here is far more interesting .
jon ! get back ! you don 't understand .
jesus , jon , i nearly choked to -- where are we --
are you kidding ? if they put him in jail he 's dead . he 'll never get to trial .
one more down . someone tried to kill adrian . . . . first time i 've ever heard him scared .
memory lane .
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check .
me neither . mine barely even fits . the thing is , i try to remember why we did it , and i can 't . helping people , or righting wrongs , or trying to save the world . . . i don 't know . it all seems so abstract .

rorschach , that was a long time ago . i mean , that -- that 's just paranoia .
toilet clogged . short fat turd . let 's get out of here .
adrian . its too late . the world is blowing up as we stand here .
janey , will you marry me ?
all right ! all right ! ! -- how 'd you find me ?
dr. manhattan , right . now if you boys care to join me , we 'll go save the world .
no . i just hastened the inevitable . he 's been ready to blow for years . i knew all it would take was a little push . so i , uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer .
before you do that , you might want to look at what i 've been looking at .
fine , but i 'm not gon na be no bulldog omega 5 .
kirill , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in chechnya , they called him the `` finger of god '' . assassination and weapons .
i know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on , right now .
go to the water , it 's that way !
perhaps he is not all he says he is .
that one i 'm real familiar with .
think again , that 's government property . you have to sign for everything . i 've got one more that wasn 't on your list .
yeah , thanks a lot .
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
a parachute . this does not argue well .
he 's a pretty good actor , though .
looks like we 're in the middle of the drug war .
it 'll work faster if i have an account number .
i 'm somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem ...
of course .
i 'm afraid without cerebro 's help , he won 't have the strength to heal himself -- and without the neuro- filter ... there 's no cerebro .

i don 't remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
sure you are , sport .
he 's busy right now .
i can assure you , there is no such creature in my genes .
let 's just say , god works too slowly .
in the road to survival , there is always sacrifice logan . we are the future ... not them . we must protect ourselves . after tonight , when the leaders of the world return home -- they will return as brothers , as mutants ... and our cause will be theirs . this is survival , i know you understand that , logan ... or is it wolverine ?
i 'll go .
here ! this cauliflower is useless to me .
goodbye , darling .
i wonder what 's got into them ?
no , but when i first came in , there was a light coming from behind that steel door .
all right ... elevate me !
but there must be a reason . this is science , not art .
well , i don 't like to see you mope .
i 'm sorry . i don 't mean to take out my frustration on you . you 've been a great help to me , and i 've let you down .
i suppose you 're right . inga ! prepare a sedative , just in case .
that 's what we 're paid for .
ja , ja .
yes , thank you . it wasn 't bad .
i 'm not sure i ... get your drift .
just an atmospheric discharge . nothing to be afraid of .
i think i 'll ... carry him .
wonderful ? it 's terrible ! terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible !
of course not .
mmmmm .
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm !
do you know the theme from 'doctor zhivago ' ?
the doctor said to allow seven minutes : no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed .
igor -- the clock ! hurry !
zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains . they 'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses .

i 'm explaining my reasons .
