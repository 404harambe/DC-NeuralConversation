forget it .
can you at least start wearing a bra ?
unlikely , but even so , she still can 't go out with you . so what 's the point ?
best case scenario , you 're back on the payroll for awhile .
she just needs time to cool off i 'll give it a day .
just smack her now .
dorsey can plow whoever he wants . i 'm just in this for the cash .
i 'm likin ' you guys better
kissing ? is that what you think happens ? kissing isn 't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .
dr. ruth ?
did he not choose a carpenter 's son to reveal himself to the world ?
indeed . the world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain .
on the contrary , your eminence . it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .
they tried ... but i didn 't let them .
you never learned how to speak my language .
we weren 't expecting immediate profits , were we ? we must have faith . we must give time for time .
is this true , brother buyl ?
officers , there 's your killer , do your duty , arrest him !
no , no , don 't talk to immigration !
you know , i don 't know . i like you . you remind me of a puppy i used to have . he pissed on the rug all the time , but i still kept him .
if you kill me and film it you 're putting a noose around your neck .
smarter than americans . you 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long . not only will americans believe me , they 'll cry for me . so ... detective eddie flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ? maybe you can propose to her now ?
you 're worried for my safety . i 'm touched .
get down on your knees .
look , man , i don 't give a shit if you want sex or not , but you 're payin ' for my time .
okay .
oleg , don 't be paranoid . you got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars , didn 't you ? i gave you half of what they gave me . look - here we are !
he 's got a point .
i understand hal . we 'll take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
dr. smyslov ... i 'm not permitted to discuss this .
let me see the tracking alignment display .
here you go sweetheart , throw it my way .
now you 're talkin ' . see ya ...
you got a girl ... shit ... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me .
she 's got the same complaint as half the goddamn population . she can 't get the job she 's trained for and it pisses her off ... anyway , what the fuck do you care ?
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes .
yeah , most cops are pretty dumb ... but since you 're the one that landed in jail what 's that make you ?
forget it . i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you ...
i 've got to play it rough with them . if they know anything , i 'm gon na know it .
hey , jack , real men don 't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but i was fantastic .
yeah , i read the report ...
just cause you say it with conviction don 't mean shit to me ... how you gon na take to a pink slip , huh ? .
shit .
what ?
in all due respect , he sounds kind of pathetic to me . the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend . have you two ace detectives checked that out ?
white turns to black . light to dark . life to death . for all eternity .
yes . of course..
good work , my son . now all we need is a way to get there .
got it ...
what is ... make love ?
it 's an honor to receive you . mr. president .
how cooperative . longdale will keep you company .
you betrayed us .
good for you .
it 's cheap , and people know to mind their own business . what have you got for me ?
okay .
yes .
`` in her dream '' ?
kristen 's story really got to her .
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy . maybe freddy can 't get to new kids without someone like me . someone to bring them to him .
and ours . it 's our grandchild .
you 're not taking my baby !
who said i ... wait , what ?
yeah , before they revoke his diploma .
mark knows i 'm not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .
that 's the only reason you 're alive ...
it wasn 't her mother . the only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party .
i don 't know !
then we 'll find another way .
pimples , heartburn , cellulite ... and no modeling career .
you know my mother -- get real . what about alice 's ?
two hours a day , six days a week .
strange you didn 't hear it . omit 274f
right , skipper .
what ? ? ?
- for horrors like yourself ?
you only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks .
got here just in time . go ahead . jump in line . maybe you 'll win a prize .
for what ?
big secret . you said the same thing to newsweek .
like any good poker player , they 're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard .
please . you can kill me but leave my daughter alone .
gravity .
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in ?
freeing stravanavitch is gon na get tens of thousands killed . i can 't live with that . i 'm not royalty . i 'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office . we don 't negotitate . not as long as i 'm president . is that understood ?
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy .
yes , sir .
and when are you going to realize , ted , that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now .
ted , you must remember what the doctor said , the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you 're sick . now take your electro-shock and you 'll be back at the space center in no time . and by the way , ted , i 'm leaving you for simon .
don 't be too long .
yes , sir .
oh , yes . come in , paul . rex will be right out .
shep , no ! i 'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there .
shep , no ! he gets so excited when new people are here .
seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted , doctor sandler says you 'll be out in a week . isn 't that wonderful ?
it 's a damn good thing you don 't know how much he hates your guts .
watch your altitude , striker . it 's too erratic . you can 't come straight in . you 've got enough fuel left for two hours flying . you 've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather .
yeah , i think he is . hey , fred !
hi , roger . good to have you aboard . victor , this is roger murdock .
would you go up , please ?
this is getting out of hand . i want you to deal with it . immediately .
that is exactly so . it is like your name ... sykes . i 'm sure it doesn 't bother you at all that it sounds like `` ss'ai k'ss '' , two words in my language which mean `` excrement '' and `` cranium '' .
we 'd like to ask you about a business associate of your , warren hubley .
three months . we learn quickly . we adapt . it is our strength ... what we were bred for , to adapt to hostile environments .
i appreciate your honesty , george .
maybe not ... i don 't know . i 'm not sure i 'm gon na go . she doesn 't need her burn-out of a father there ...
i must trust you , matthew . i can not stop this without you .
ten seconds , people . look sharp !
vasquez , take point . let 's move .
no ! the answer is no . now please go . i 'm sorry . just go , would you .
look , maybe the thing didn 't even exist , right ? and if i 'd made it a major security situation , the administration would 've stepped in . then no exclusive rights , nothing .
sorry to disappoint you .
aye-firmative .
we didn 't miss anything .
oh , god . jesus . this ain 't happening .
just get back here !
that 's because i blew it out the goddamn airlock ! like i said .
of course .
oh , thank you , sir !
madame , i will respect his . he asked me to stay here .
young man , i am no stranger to theatres . i 'm no stranger to insolence !
really ? oh , grazie , signore ! sono commosso ! e un onore per mo eccezionale . compositore brilliante e famossissimo !
my dear fellow , there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening . i think i 'm right in saying that , aren 't i , court composer ?
why not ? oh , come , papa ! what better way could i spend it than on you ? my kissable , missable , suddenly visible papa !
i want you to come back with me to salzburg , my son .
yes . i can live in or out just as you wish .
well , yes ! on the whole . i suppose . how long have you been playing , fraulein ?
but , your majesty -
certainly , herr director .
did we ?
yes , indeed . goodnight to you all now . it was perfection - truly !
no , but we 're about to .
regardless of what you think , lieutenant , the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him .
oh , is he ? we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city . we 're fools to tolerate it .
all right , let him ! i 'm sick and tired of hearing about him . if he wants to run the bank , let him do it . i don 't want any part of it .
stand back , inspector . let me out of here , or i 'll shoot you !
gee , thanks , mr. dickson
good . you 've got nothing to worry about . soon as the report comes in , you 'll be released . and listen , don 't talk so loud . take it easy . coast a little .
don 't you think i know it ?
yeah , swell .
that 's all , mrs. halligan . thanks .
then where were you ?
okay , matt .
zee , i 'm pleased you came .
i can hit those boys from here . we just need a distraction .
stop by our spread after that , tell our ma we 're all right . we 'll go to doc mimms .
twenty ? !
pff . all we been through , the thought never crossed my mind .
you ride like a comanche .
so we got a plan ?
it 's the scientific method . it 's all the rage .
bob here 'll kill a man for sneezing , and he 's the best shot in the gang .
somebody 's in a vengeful smiting mood today .
not to mention my men who lost their lives .
oh god , just get it over with .
actually , that 's none of your business , christie , hut i can assure you it certainly wasn 't cheap .
hi . pat bateman .
but wait , harold , what do you mean ?
i want to get high off this ; bateman , not sprinkle it on my fucking all-bran .
ask me a question .
hmmmm .
thanks . it slipped my mind completely .
god ... i guess ... i was probably returning videotapes .
i could tell you that , halberstam , but then i 'd have to kill you .
anything ? that 's not even credible . if he wants to go up there ? to check it out ? i think you should encourage him . it 's his life . but everybody 's treating him like this -- valuable object . you 're hurting your own case .
you 're right . it 's -- a working relationship . don 't know what i was expecting .
don 't spend too much time searching . you ever vetted somebody 's old code before ? it 's a different skill . stay close to the surface . the best-hidden secrets are in plain sight . you know the best place to hide a leaf , right ? in a tree .
i do know , gary . i feel the same way . i thought i was coming here for a job . but it 's meant a lot more .
then and now . but not right now .
oh yeah ?
thanks , basil . maybe the nineties aren 't so bad after all .
sadly , no . hold on ! i always keep this on me just in case .
sure .
these are the latest word in android replicant technology . lethal , efficient , brutal . and no man can resist their charms . send in the soldiers !
people have to tell me these things . i 've been frozen for thirty years , throw me a bone here . ok , no problem . here 's my second plan . back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a `` laser . '' using this laser , we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth , which we scientists call the `` ozone layer . '' slowly but surely , ultraviolet rays would pour in , increasing the risk of skin cancer . that is , unless the world pays us a hefty ransom .
all right then ... ... five million dollars !
ok , scott , no one really wants to `` kill '' anyone here . they say it , but they don 't mean it .
after the cold war ...
not all tradition is bad , mrs. peel . no thank you .
very good , steed ...
i 'm a wanted woman , i know ...
you 're saying i have no choice .
well , i can 't possibly go like this .
deb , i want to throw you a shower .
yeah . right . all the things that make life worth living .
women !
hey , man , congratulations !
great , mom .
my pleasure , al ... always happy to help out in a pinch ... excuse me . i better call my service ... tell them where i am .
because i love her . what can i tell you ?
can 't i just maim it a little ?
in a second ... and you 're irresponsible . show some initiative , try to better yourself , stop showing off , actions speak louder than words .
of course .
i don 't know . maybe it 's because i love debbie or maybe it 's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad . i 'm not sure .
you got it .
great . i was wondering , how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing ?
there 's a fire . we 've got a job here . let 's get on with it .
c'mon , let 's crawl home .
shut up !
i don 't want to be your friend , brian .
hey , do i know you ?
stephen 's not staying here now , brian . he moved out last april .
and die !
that 's my problem . just put in my bet .
i order out mostly . so what do i owe this visit to ?
are you crazy ? the joint is crawling with cops now . you wan na go to rikers ? go to the hoosegow ?
let'em try . i will kill to make this happen .
manray better not be bleeding to death . i need him . after we 're done he can do whatever he wants to do , until then , he 's ours .
c'mon . you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family . you gave your brother a shot . that 's all anybody can ask for , an opportunity , a chance , a shot . he got his .
i just turned twenty .
how do you do , sir ?
faith , i think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word .
yes , papa .
you know that was like a quadruple negative ?
we found him like this --
hey !
we don 't know . west is dead .
coast guard , special detective detail . we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk .
mr. hardy ?
my heart weeps .
and here you are going out of house . how 's that make you feel , jules ?
he can wait . kendall 's out of surgery .
got it .
everyone 's capable of murder , osborne .
he wanted more than that .
yes . exactly .
really ! that 's wonderful .
yes .
you gon na miss your bus .
word wit'cha . in private .
ask the chef .
i just know how you get . good to know , them butterflies still in ya gut .
i don 't know , but i been told , them georgia women sweet jelly roll .
ronnie ...
thanks .
what 's the problem here ?
only one way to find out ... get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night .
somebody must be suffering somewhere , you 're being so nice .
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms , carrying official documents .
we were worried to death . it 's awfully kind of you .
here 's your check , my boy . thank you .
you have a little boy . he shows you his butterfly collection , plus the killing jar .
ugh .
reaction time is a factor in this , so please pay attention . answer quickly as you can .
what one ?
young man , stop right there !
get away from me ! !
good for you .
okay !
no .
shit is a french word ?
no ! there 's an adult bookstore back there ! i 'll be right back !
oh , you got a problem with that ?
amen .
you 're goddamn right i am !
fallout shelter .
aunt barbara . i 'll try not to get depressed .
shut up . gim me your lipstick . hey , pretty , pretty .
okay . great !
our mother can see through bags .
right .
yeah . it 's been twenty-seven years .
yeah , it 's st. patty 's day . everyone 's irish tonight . now , why don 't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us ?
rocco !
just called ta torture us did ya ?
well , what'ya do ?
nothing . go ahead .
then you 're going to have to dye it , anthony . we 've got to hide our identities . especially after bob crashed the car .
thanks .
hold it .
ok , dad .
sure .
bourne comes here ? why ?
i do remember something good . all the time . i remember you .
jason . you know exactly what to do . that is your mission now .
he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride . but he sends his greetings -- and says that i speak for all the bruces . and for scotland .
that depends on the man .
i could crush you like a roach .
it does me good to see you .
nobles ? what does that mean -- to be noble ? your title gives you claim to the throne of our country . but men don 't follow titles , they follow courage ! your arm speaks louder than your tongue . our people know you . noble and common , they respect you . if you would lead them toward freedom , they would follow you . and so would i .
my father has a bad memory , too ?
okay .
cute , evan .
you need to see the prison shrink , man .
you know my father ?
i see a car .
are you sure ? not even with my father ?
lem me guess . would that be where the memories are stored ?
that 's probably why hannibal lecter 's so smart .
so let 's go . this place creeps me out .
damn . your dad did this ?
nice to see you , too . can i come in ?
he saved mrs. halpern ? please , the twisted fuck .
and i 'll tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors . one step closer and i 'll shove this up your ass !
uh-huh . mom says i have your eyes and your --
look , jason , i need some fast answers if i 'm ever gon na fix what i 've done .
you 're such a retard !
well ?
come up here a minute .
rick , don 't be a fool . take me into your confidence . you need a partner .
-- we might as well be frank , monsieur . it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca . and the germans have outlawed miracles .
well , good luck . but be careful . you know you 're being shadowed ?
good day .
i 'm on their blacklist already , their roll of honor .
it doesn 't matter .
no , rick . no , you see , victor laszlo is my husband ... and was , even when i knew you in paris .
-- you don 't even have to say it . i 'll believe . goodnight , dear .
very well .
are you quite finished with us ?
you were a czechoslovakian . now you are a subject of the german reich !
i have already heard about this cafe , and also about mr. rick himself .
i expected no less , captain .
you weren 't always so carefully neutral . we have a complete dossier on you .
my dear major , we are trying to cooperate with your government , but we can not regulate the feelings of our people .
when it comes to women , you 're a true democrat .
-- hello , ilsa .
that was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon . we just barely got cleaned up in time to open .
good evening , mr. blaine .
you said it ! here 's looking at you , kid .
the germans 'll be here pretty soon now , and they 'll come looking for you . and don 't forget there 's a price on your head .
thank you for fucking up my life .
no .
i didn 't steal it , and he wasn 't crippled .
yeah , well ... couldn 't be helped .
i didn 't know what really being alone was . no one back here does .
that new roof , that 's your doing .
oh no , the prodigal son 's home . we bring out the store bought .
this is my home . i 'm part of the wallpaper .
the tide saved me , mom . i lived by it . i 'm just wondering where it will take me next .
borrowed . i borrowed it .
hallelujah .
what 's it all about ? it 's about being so thirsty you 'd crush a fish 's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that 's what it 's about .
it claims to restore monthly regularity .
i know .
good night , daddy .
it should taper off tomorrow , but it can come back again . you have cramps ? they 'll ease up , almost entirely . as long as the bleeding isn 't heavy , it 's normal .
okay ...
she *did* love him ! how many women have you known ?
yes ... and no . when you come here , you don 't really care about the movie .
no . it ain 't muddy . muddy 's just ...
actually , i volunteered .
oh , i would love that , wally .
right .
it 's *your* splice ! you blame me for everything !
i don 't know . just promise me one thing .
yeah , well ... you could move on with *us* , man ! you could move on somewhere *warm* !
you think daddy 's gon na let me go anywhere ? i ain 't going *nowhere* .
rose , listen -- don 't *do* anything . you know , i mean to yourself . please listen ...
what view ?
yeah , we can wait all night for the water to come back on -- you just go on and take your time .
that 's right . i know you understand how i feel , homer -- you is breakin ' them rules , too . ain 't that right ?
i wasn 't sure if you 'd make it .
i envy you guys . taking a chance like that .
jake ? right . uh-huh ... uh-huh ... yeah , it 's going through --
probably safe in the hands of the federal government .
people have tried this before , jake . it 's never worked . teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it . last year , mumps got pinched in l.a .
i got ta work off some of this adrenaline . i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn . anybody want in ?
jake , i mean , come on --
you sure ?
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
i 'd like this cashed , please .
don 't worry about moonan . we got him covered . when ... ? it was him . there 's a shipment coming through tonight . kennedy .
my wife and i are just taking a little vacation .
oooh . sassy . what do you care who feels me up , jake ? unless it kinda gotcha going . did it , jake ? getcha going ?
you sold me out . you should have trusted me like i trusted you . you fucked up . you fucked up huge .
michelle strigo . loan officer .
i 'm sorry .
you were right . he 's trying to fuck you . you want it , you got ta get it at the airport ...
i want him for something big and to do that , we have to catch him in the act .
look , i 'm not a confrontational person by nature .
i don 't know anything about it .
i 'll see you in my dreams .
you know where i 'm from ?
thanks .
thanks .
or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is .
yeah ?
you 're in the last two seconds , you don 't cut the crap .
justine was not an unwilling participant .
no , i meant this .
only when i meet someone i have to know everything about .
i don 't know how to break this to you , normal , we 're all looking for another job .
save your money , stud muffin . the lady at the end of the bar sends her love .
bye .
what ? that 's disgusting !
disco blows dogs for quarters .
lex , am i gon na have to lock you in the trunk till we reach detroit ? don 't worry , these babies are built for speed .
check .
what ? ! are you mentally deranged , jam ?
jam , not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth ! okay , we 're here , we got nothing , and we got an hour and a half . we 're totally committed . it 's time to brainstorm .
if your mom so much as smells those tickets , they 're history , and we get screwed outta seeing kiss for the third year in a row , the third year !
hello summer detention .
let 's lift up her shirt .
say , chongo , perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the kiss concert our weasly friend won 't be attending .
that 's easy . antiseptics .
she wrote it . there are chapters in this book that describe the stuff i 've been seeing . it can 't just be a coincidence . will you come see her with me ?
it 's safe here .
no , a year of partying is enough . she 'll be going to harvard this fall .
we will not have this kind of language at the dinner table .
well ... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds . when they flood the house . that like ... destruction is a form of creation . so the fact that they burn the money is ... ironic . they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart . they want to change things .
the pta is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school 's curriculum .
bitch !
annette , why don 't you just see if there 's any beer left in that can and relax a bit .
oh yah-sure , i know what some of your big city , no bra wearin ' , hairy- legged women 's libbers say , `` pageants are old-fashioned '' and , uh , and `` demeaning '' to the girls --
yah -- gladys had me order that swan special made from mexico in case becky won . i do a lotta business with those people . i always offer to pay 'em in tacos . whoo , they love that .
that 's why we lutherans use grape koolaid for the blood of christ .
you 'd think they 'd build the parking lot of america to go with the mall of america !
i think we oughtta have a standing army , so we can save money on chairs .
we 've got ta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men . you know how to make love ?
that 's not bad for any day .
well , why not say the least and get it over with ?
this is terrible !
steady on , treves . have a seat .
oh , no . i would never think it ! it 's so beautiful . you are so ... i 'll give it a place of honor , here , next to my mother .
hello , my name is john merrick .
i thought as much .
not quite yet , mrs. mothershead . there seems to be some difficulty this morning .
welcome home , john .
that 's right !
what d'you mean ?
you 're just saying that .
what is it ?
i will join my grandfather there .
over the edge of the world .
i never do ...
i don 't know . i 'm so ... i can 't believe she 'd be so goddamn immature !
just a little overworked , maybe .
it 's okay . i didn 't think you were .
yes .
you didn 't say anything about my hair .
hide me somewhere deeper ? somewhere buried ?
and what are you like ? a wino ?
i didn 't want to do this . but i had to or they would 've called me a girl .
don 't do this to me now , joel . really .
maybe after the holidays then .
easy come , easy go .
the world isn 't going to end , you dummy ; i hope you know that much . but it is going to change . it 's going to change drastically , and probably in your lifetime . the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change , and they may be right , since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue . but there are far worse catastrophes coming ... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization , in other words , unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption . it isn 't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes , but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault . so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan , all right , but there 'll be some of us it 'll miss . little pockets of humanity . like the clock people . like you two honeys , if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave . there 's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine , nuclear accident , plague , weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn 't survive in that cave .
if i flinch when you say you love me , it 's both our problems . my confusion becomes your confusion . students confuse teachers , patients confuse psychiatrists , lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts ... .
i 'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it . now step aside , old man .
i don 't need sleep , dj . i need answers .
the science workstation has power , i 'll see if i can find the crew from here .
do it .
captain miller , the foredecks are just ahead .
check the core for radiation . carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries .
what makes you think i 'll miss ?
starck ...
that 's enough !
justin ?
five seconds .
i don 't think this is a good idea , we don 't even know what happened on that ship ...
if they were in stasis , i 'd get a location , but these readings , they 're all over the ship . it doesn 't make any sense .
it means nothing .
trust me , this ain 't one of those times .
wouldn 't want to keep vic waiting .
and you can ? power it up ?
i don 't care about rocks , i care about you . you bring him back in one piece , or you can forget being best man .
this wasn 't our first stop , in case you forgot nasa . and victor 's not that bad . he 's just a little ... larger than life .
got it , teach .
forget it , egghead . i 'm good as is .
actually , the engines are smes . hydrogenbase , carbon propellant . couple generations past your last ride . i 'm not as dumb as you look .
what about you ?
they 're not costumes .
that 's why . because i could have any other woman ... you know , when they asked caesar `` why england , '' he said , `` because it 's not mine . ''
great minds think alike .
excuse me ?
reed . shh . just be quiet . and look up .
the number 's seventy-five . and it 's applications and patents .
sure .
not much . we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
same old reed . all analysis , no action . wasn 't that the problem with you two ?
then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass ... it 's ironic , isn 't it ? you 're finally the perfect woman for him ... because you 're his science project .
look , brad , i 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this . we 're almost out of high school , this is our last year . i think we owe it to ourselves to be free , and meet some new people . then , if we get back together , we 'll know it 's the right thing .
manager ! !
okay , dennis .
he 's my friend , too .
let 's continue .
well , it pretty much speaks for itself . peter , you want to run with it ?
fascinating .
merv , i 'm thinking ... i 've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards .
stacy . what does it matter ? he 's a stereo salesman . you want to marry him ? you want to have kids with him ? you want this guy to come home , fifty years old , and he 's still got that little pacific stereo badge on ? come on .
god , i don 't think so . better look in the house .
i don 't know , i 'm just so depressed . everything is just so ... depressing .
he is . don 't worry , i 'll get it to him .
what ?
wait a minute ! come back and have a beer !
my heart !
and eat them ! that bastard won 't get away with this ! what 's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism ?
look you better put that blade away and get your head straight . i have to put the car in the lot .
she 's perfect for this gig . these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her . we can set her up in one of these back street motels , hang pictures of jesus all over the room , then turn these pigs loose on her ... hell she 's strong ; she 'll hold her own .
we keep it quiet . it 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to talk about upstairs . not with the press around .
finish the fucking story ! what happened ? ! what about the glands ?
inspector rock will pay you . in cash . a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month .
two glasses of ice water with ice .
you 're under arrest !
i know you 're cops , but i thought you were just here for that convention . i swear ! all i wanted to do was clean up the room . i don 't know anything about dope !
no ! no ! i swear to jesus i never heard of that stuff !
her fella .
there 's a tunnel .
the door ... on three .
oh yeah ?
whoa !
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back . there 's cars back there , right ?
... no , ralph . i don 't believe i ever was sick . but when you 're treated like a patient long enough , you 're apt to act like one ...
i can thank you for that . it was a hard-earned talent .
quite right !
i 'm ... dying .
no , no , they 're all dead ...
you 're right . it makes no sense .
god , but i love that sexy talk .
whatever you make yourself .
god , but i love that macho talk ! emergency generators ! the indian used campfires .
rocky road .
the truth hurts .
pops , when you 're right , you 're right , and you are right .
`` we 'll all have lunch . '' good idea . oh , and let 's be sure to invite this sociologist , too -- just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards !
fuck me .
that aside for the moment , i 'm struck by the tenor , the ill-spirit of your report ... the degrading remarks by other aviators ... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations ... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior . in my seven years on this committee , i 've never seen a downed aviator treated like this . never . i 'm deeply disturbed by this report , mr. hayes . not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well .
lieutenant thomas wickwire .
fuck . basher-basher , this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction . stand by for a prc fix ...
every class has its surprises , pyro . this one 'll be no different .
this is insane . you 've got no proof .
mighta been civilian .
it also seems like a problem with the men 's attitude , sir . so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead .
your new roommate .
somebody throw a tent over this circus .
it 's good to see you , nick .
i don 't get it . if it 's the first of its kind , how can it be pregnant ?
your station won 't have any easier time contacting the military than i did .
oh my god ! they 're coming !
speak of the devil .
he 's scum ! as far as he 's concerned you 're just a pair of breasts that talk .
that 's the problem . he did .
i don 't think so .
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise .
we know .
but you don 't know for sure !
you don 't have the authority to do that .
i am not permitted to speak of such things .
shut up . ' just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity ,
could they be the miners ?
turn on the translation circuit .
this is great ! they 're going to start eating each other out there .
and determination .
don 't do anything rash , please , benedict .
you go too far , benedict .
tell mrs. washington i am compelled to stay a while longer .
i ain 't forgot about the freedom .
more than that , sir ... my orders from congress .
lafayette will not be happy ...
and is that the most horrible thing in the world ?
it 's a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for .
to learn to shoot cannon ?
they go back home to keep their families alive , stay into the spring to plant . then , they start coming back to us .
as does your ability , horatio . we must talk further , when it 's more convenient .
i don 't know : delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things . and , if he 's popular with his men ...
i think many would like to see him commander-in-chief .
what can he do ? the british have massive superiority .
you 're no fool , george . you never have been .
you wrong me , general ; i am an officer and a horse-shoer .
words , words , words ! sally has been tutoring george in the philosophies , isn 't that right ?
that land belongs to the strongest .
god damn you , sam adams ! you wanted a revolutionary army and now that we 've really got one it scares you more than it does the british !
farrah . come here .
don 't fade on me now , bear . not unless you wan na hold farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons .
tell you what ...
by friday , man , or you 're fuckin ' dead as disco .
ray . look at me .
whatta you got there ... some kinda pop nine , the fuckin ' fiat of guns , always jammin ' at the wrong time .
where you been , harry ?
or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken . you have to understand the loan shark 's in business the same as anybody else . he isn 't in it to hurt people . he 's in it to make money .
that 's right . as a matter of fact ...
i mean , at least bo 's invested in three of my movies .
don 't waste your time , harry . the guy 's not much of a movie fan . now c'mon , gim me the key .
i 'll find you , leo ...
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant .
the guy 's setting you up . you pulled out of their freaks deal so he 's paying you back .
yeah , harry , you look like you belong in one of your horror movies .
what 's momo gon na want with an old place , shows old movies people don 't care about no more . outside of maybe turnin ' it into a porno house , i don 't think he 's gon na give much of a fuck . and you already got a job .
come on in .
that 's where you got the idea ?
oh , yeah , sure .
thanks .
and after all , you have such morals .
yeah , a ship that 's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago . you don 't think that 's just a little freaky ?
we 'll see who 's dreamin ' , m'man .
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat .
after fifty years there ain 't nothin ' left but shoe leather .
yeah , well how the hell you get something like that wrong ? that 's a damn big boat . it 's either sunk or it ain 't .
then what the hell happened to him ?
the damn thing 's been floating around for god knows how long and it hasn 't hit anything yet . so we take it easy . a little of the old push pull .
sounds reasonable .
man , it gives me the creeps . we got no business towing a ship that size anyway . i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway .
then it happened before they scuttled her .
so we get a little more for the boat . besides , the gold 'll be safer where it is .
how about you epps ?
yeah , yeah .
yeah , reconsider fucking his shit up .
there 's a charming thought .
better than starving to death .
i didn 't sign up to go home empty handed . and i sure ain 't gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this .
they must 've scuttled it . nobody just lets a ship float away .
maybe . but there 's always somebody whose interest 's at stake .
let 'em ask . this ship 's legally ours now .
so we cut her loose and wait it out . a little weather couldn 't be anything she hasn 't seen before .
not for fifty million . an ocean liner maybe . but fifty million in gold , they come looking for .
it 's worth the effort . believe me . besides we 're gon na need her to prove the salvage .
not much at all , i guess . retire . live out my golden years and all that .
oh , all right ... party-pooper ! just let me put a few things away .
it 's just an excuse for us to spend time with you .
i told you - my manager was a total asshole ! don 't worry , i 'm going to get another job ... and anyway , i have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime ...
who knows ?
fuck dana . i 'm sick of dana .
i can treat him any way i want to - i 'm an adult ! leave me alone !
i 'm calling it my `` contraption '' - we 're going to surround it with a boma- a fence , to you- and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door .
well , he got away , didn 't he ? riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off .
don 't they have to be ? ...
i feel the same about the bridge . this country certainly didn 't ask for it , doesn 't need it .
actually , i 'm not eating lunch today . i have an appointment . in fact , i 'd better go .
peter , do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things .
now you 're talking .
okay .
tonight ?
the upper west side .
do i ?
this won 't wait until tomorrow , venkman . it 's hot and it 's ready to pop .
it may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source .
it 's not that thing you do with your nostrils , is it ?
okay , but you 're missing all the fun .
oh , right , you told me that . they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese , as i recall . how about you , winston ?
come on , winston . we can 't quit now . the holidays are coming up . it 's our best season .
you think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true ?
it 's okay . i have my senior lifesaving card .
so what do you think it was ?
spengler , see if you can find the word `` zuul '' in any of the literature . i 'll take miss barrett home and check out her apartment .
no . if i moved out now i 'd be acknowledging that what happened was real . i 'm not ready to do that .
talk to my accountant .
what calls ?
here are tonight 's calls .
will you guys relax ? we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - professional paranormal investigations and eliminations . the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams .
she 's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is .
or even a race memory , stored in the collective unconscious . and i wouldn 't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either .
i blame myself .
good idea . were any other words spoken that you remember ?
and caesar ! let 's not forget to serve caesar !
commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father . except that he can 't heave out his ghost .
do you want posters , too ?
oh , but with the army behind you , you could become extremely political . not a republican by any chance ?
the dangerous man , caesar , is the man who doesn 't care .
until your confirmation date .
i 'm certain father will be in better humors by then . now , honor us with your presence at dinner . i 'll join you as soon as i see my father 's physician .
narcissus will never support you , caesar , he has too much of a philosophical temperament .
caesar , i did my best . the colosseum isn 't under my control ...
yes ! the days of imperial prerogative and disdain for the senate are over -- thanks to your father ! now report to the senate , master galen : what is marcus ' state ?
what the hell are you talking about , greek ?
elaine -- right now i don 't feel like talking much . i 'm sorry about everything but i think i 'll just do this now .
ahhh .
benjamin , don 't you ever take that girl out .
no . i think you 'll want to wait on that .
yes -- oh -- oh -- yes , --
only in mutual advantages -- moreover ...
i 'll remember you , mr. kringelein .
very simple -- i 've always liked the way you dressed , preysing -- english , isn 't it ?
next week .
wait a minute . i 've got to ask myself .
don 't worry about me , mr. general director pryesing -- worry about yourself . there has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four .
the troupe , the scenery , everything -- all on board , waiting . you have a rehearsal in vienna tomorrow morning . come , madam , are you mad ?
hah .
goody !
you do if you 're where i am . where you want to be . how 'd you get that punch in the stomach , roy ?
that 's right .
oh , you 'll live , lilly .
what ?
no , baby . come to mama .
yes or no . they 're both easier at home . okay ?
better take 'em to virgil 's downtown . we got a dead body in there .
you 're so predictable .
no -- please listen ! they 're coming ... coming for me and my baby .
him .
it 's a rune ... thorn .
that 's the whole idea of living in the country . i thrive on the seclusion .
please try to understand , terence . i 've already made up my mind .
he 's a man . tell him you 're a man .
sir ?
have some .
he thought he could take my place . it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i don 't think he 's man enough to do that .
out !
no doubt paul thinks it stinks .
tonight 's the night .
penelope ! we 're late !
why can 't i meet him now ?
so i guess we 're both fucked , huh ? but at least you get to go to heaven . i don 't get shit .
research , my ass . i suppose these are the 'extra expenses ' i 've been paying for ? and in the middle of the morning , too .
what do you mean ?
if anyone can help , he can .
and what about you ?
behind this door . a dark entity -- evil , ancient and hungry .
oh -- you don 't wan na know what i think . topside , now .
hold on -- hold on -- i thought we checked this place . fakes , and reproductions .
i can live with that .
no !
you mean we 're moving in ?
i tricked you into meeting some people you 'd think were great . i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way .
it 's gon na be fine . these people are ready for anything .
god , you ask a lot of questions .
sure .
it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg .
follow me .
please go to no trouble .
point conceeded , mr. macleod .
do what you must .
thanks .
he certainly -- hic -- does !
certified and everything . got it right here in my wallet ... what ? no , he 's not here -- i 'm in a phone booth .
thank you .
fine .
i don 't think she 'll need you very much -- i aim to do most of the protecting myself .
yes , i know ... hildy , will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath ? she didn 't even know i was in town ...
thanks . i 'll phone hildy right away to get that story .
come on , hildy , we 've got to keep going ! sorry , bruce , but --
say , i want to be sure , too !
give me the district attorney 's office . i 'll tell you what you 'll be doing -- making brooms in the state penitentiary . hello , d'arrasty ! this is hartwell . come over to my office , will you ? i 've just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions .
no kidding ?
how do you like that ? here i am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that 's the thanks i get !
okay , walter .
hildy , you think i could ? after this story ? here ! you 're just nervous .
i don 't care what you say . i 'm going to find bruce 's mother . oh-h ... i 'm going out and find her !
take that mush out of your mouth !
yeah ! well , i do the firing , too . remember that , duffy , and keep a civil tongue in your head .
run down and get some smelling salts , will you ?
it 's easy for you to talk . you 're retired . we 're still working .
what have you got , hildy ?
i tell you , it 's a screwy set-up . we better hold onto 'em both .
yeah . but i --
and you fell for it , pete . it frightens me what i 'd like to do to you . who else knows about this ?
it 's a frame-up ! some imposter !
i was just going to !
yeah , you don 't want to tire him out , doctor .
oh-h-h ... was she hurt ?
okay , hildy . well , we can 't get any official statement --
i 'm quoting my son , and he has never lied to me .
let 'em take me . it 's better that way .
it 's a simple story . earl williams works for the e.j . mcclosky manufacturing company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years . he starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty . a year ago the mcclosky company goes out of business and williams loses his job . take it away , fred wilson !
apparently so .
don 't be so cheeky , bruce .
thanks . i hope you can come for the launching .
if king and country call , mac , you go as soon as i will .
there , there , my baby .
happy days . when you 're bigger , bill , i 'll teach you the googly .
not loving enough . that is a terrible thing to do to someone . i suppose i did it to clive . always held something back .
my aunt in australia has offered..
i know you mean well .
you know something , molly ? i like it on my own . i never got used to sharing a bed , not really .
happy as can be . in the old groove .
if you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate ... it 's easier .
ok , boss .
and the spare is safely sitting in jerry 's garage .
i mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles .
i suppose . i mean they 're obviously all bonkers , but i guess they 're harmless .
it 's a girl .
she looks like she stinks .
huh ?
what !
negative . shit , we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero .
well , go get her .
right .
right .
anyway , there 's not much else out that way ... so , i figure maybe there 's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms .
nothing ! i 'll be out in a minute !
it 's an animal urge , puff . it 's nothing to be ashamed of .
i 'm really glad you two found each other .
nathan !
that 's a great idea .
please , nathan . i really need this . you 've been working late a lot .
absolutely !
ugnh .
i know . been there myself . we 've all been there , haven 't we , miss packard ?
deal the cards .
yeah , i went out for a couple of hours .
twelve . cross side .
preacher , gim me my coat , will ya ?
i 'll go . we 'll both go . far away .
okay .
i will . but isn 't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
george , you 're acting very strangely .
good night .
i 'm sorry , mr. gardner . i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone .
no , mom . it wasn 't a plane .
if we do , we 'll both die virgins . but at last we 'll be together .
think nothing of it , spanky .
that 's not your call to make , mr. nimziki .
you 're meddling with powers you can not possibly comprehend .
find something ?
i can reach it . i can reach it ...
relax .
of course . the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices . the british army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of 1857 .
something magical . a sacred rock .
what 're you talking about -- i 'm not a dope fiend ! i saw it ! i 'll show you !
i am only his humble servant , but the maharajah usually listens to my advice .
yeah , that 's what happened ...
why ?
don 't get your hopes up -- where 's the antidote ?
get over here , damn it ! short round , come on , grab onto me tight !
he 'll be okay . he 's a good kid .
wearing your jewels to bed , princess ?
a what ? !
where are you going ? wait !
that 's nice .
why ?
i love you too .
if he was able , what would he say .
no , you fucked you ! don 't invert stuff ! big tobacco tried to smear wigand ; you bought it . the wall street journal , here , not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment , refutes big tobacco 's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination ! and now , even now , when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed , the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi , the cat totally out of the bag , you 're still standing here debating ! don , what the hell else ... do you need ?
no , thank you .
i can 't ... i 've got to fly to boston tomorrow .
what ?
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now . so you care about what you 're thought of in america . and in america , at this moment in time , hezbollah does not have a face . that 's why .
no . we don 't do that . you 've seen `` 60 minutes '' and mike wallace . so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity . you also know we are the highest-rated , most-respected , tv-magazine news show in america .
then ... you 're in a state of conflict , jeff .
good . you have kids ?
run that sandefur piece on `` nicotine 's not addictive . '' run that on-camera . then cut right to wigand with `` i believe they perjured ... '' then go wide to the ceos all taking the oath . back on jeff and play the pause after the word `` felt '' on the b-side ...
what do you want to do , lowell , look up my ass , too ... !
and i 've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before the wall street journal runs . i am trying to protect you , man !
i told you we know each other , baby . mr. massey represented my ex-brother- in law . martin reiser ?
miles , i know you 're busy and that you charge by the hour so i 'll come to the point . howard and i are planning to marry .
oh joe , be happy for us . i 'll pay you the twenty thousand .
shut up . i was a lawyer . just like you . and my clients ? whores just like you .
i know you do .
i 'm not talking about dollars , studmuffin . i 'm talking about --
that 's true .
i wish i had your discipline .
they bought her speech . if i was only in it for rex 's money , he shouldn 't have to give me any .
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs . he had a device he called the intruder .
-- the coin ?
mother ?
maybe next time .
well , you can live here as long as you want . do you have any plans ?
well , if it isn 't the groom himself ! you 're just in time , king .
wellof all thewell maybe you 'll be interested to know your bag 's gone .
forget it . i didn 't do it for you . his voice got on my nerves .
darling !
goodnight , mr. warne .
come here , you little fool !
oh , excuse me .
oh , boy ! what a yarn ! what a yarn ! get me hank on the phone . got ta hold up the morning edition .
yes , but we 're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance . three years later and he 's still classified ? they gave us his grammar school records , a study of his pubic hairs ... put it in context , bill , of what we know about oswald . lonely kid , no father , unstable childhood , high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy , joins the marines at 17 . he learns russian , he acts overtly marxist with two other marines , but he 's stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate . he 's discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother 's sick . he stays home 3 days , then with a $ 1500 ticket from a $ 203 bank account , he goes to moscow ...
maybe i have a little more respect for this country 's institutions than you do , susie . you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob , the cia , fbi , and army intelligence and who knows what else , when you know you can 't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people ! we got leaks everywhere ! we 're going to trial here ! what the hell do we really got ? oswald , ruby , banister , ferrie are dead . shaw - maybe he 's an agent , i don 't know , but as a covert operator in my book he 's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality .
y'ever heard of a double agent , bill ? i 'm beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist ... after the arrest , 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again . now here 's another one for you : what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine ?
let 's start making some assumptions about the man . why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswald 's ? this is not a thin trail , gentlemen , it is a very wide one . who found the evidence ? who set him up ? lou , bill , susie , i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas , new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it 's the same guy .
well , they offered you the carrot , and you turned it down ... you know what 's coming next , don 't you , boss ?
would you say this `` leon '' was actually lee harvey oswald ?
same one . i didn 't know no impersonator .
yes , it was about 11 in the morning . i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass , in a rented car - a blue valiant . i 'll never forget that day .
well maybe you 're right , jim . i 'll give you one hour to solve the case ... until the kids are in bed . then you 're mine and mr. kennedy can wait 'til morning . come on , everybody say goodnight to daddy .
you know i don 't like these tribal rituals , freckle face . i 'm interviewing clay shaw this morning .
i remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg . he limped . don 't get me wrong , he 's not one of those , you know , limp wrists . he 's a butch john . you 'd meet him on the street , you 'd never snap . you could go fishing with him , play poker with him , you 'd never snap in a million years . so one night we were over at ferrie 's place . having a party . sometime in the late summer of '63 .
we need him back .
oh , that 's not a problem .
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here .
what time do you have to be there ?
the usual things . i 'm a flight attendant with cabo air .
i 'm tellin ' you , i don 't know nothin ' about that fuckin ' shit .
what if i 've figured a way ?
a broadway shopping bag .
sure .
i wouldn 't go so far as to say that .
oh , you gon na tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money i got in the world ! let me tell you the reason , motherfucker ! the reason is , your ass ain 't worth a shit no more !
you think you could do that ?
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv .
i was gon na tell you ...
me , too .
he was upset . he thought people were following him .
nobody 's been talking to nobody . you don 't have a case , you hear me ? it 's pure and simple . now leave me alone . okay ?
what else did he say , jake ?
no . don 't move me .
you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met . one second you 're a screaming banshee and the next you 're florence nightingale . who are you ? that 's what i want to know . will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up .
i can do anything i want .
stick with me , kid .
done ?
two more charges to go .
thorgan ? you coming ? !
at least try to get him alive ... will ya brodski ?
look ! just get everyone together , get off the ship ... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come ! that 's the only way you 're going to live .
i 'm on my way .
keep your shirt on ! i 'm working on it . you won 't believe what we found . adrienne ! stoney !
would you ?
try to calm down . just think , you 're going to be famous !
maybe she tripped .
obviously so .
exactly .
rizzo , a shuttle out in the middle of space ? we 'll die oout there .
you hired me , remember ? it 's my $ 10,000 . it 's my shark ...
i was only reacting to what i was told .
i can 't stand here doing nothing !
so would i . come on in .
real fine stuff but it won 't mean a thing to mr. whitey , of course ... he didn 't go to schools in electronics . he was born with what he does best . eat . he 's a swimming appetite . 'course he might eat this stuff , but then i 've seen him eat a rocking chair , too . next time , ask me .
let 's just cut him open and see what 's inside ...
i always think you 're cute . i think you 're beautiful .
here 's to dovetailing interests .
isn 't that great ? i got it when i was in japan with my band . she reminds me of you .
really ? fingernails ?
a maker 's mark , please . up .
so , then , you really think you 're going to go ahead with this ?
naah . i 'm already pregnant , so they figure nothing worse could happen to me . i got ta bounce anyway . it was nice seeing you guys again .
my dad used to be in the army , but now he 's just your average hvac specialist . he and my mom got divorced when i was five . she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona ...
once ! and she didn 't die , if you recall !
i also have good teeth . no cavities . we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk .
i think the last one was defective . the plus sign looked more like a division sign .
silencio ! i just drank my weight in sunny d. and i have to go , pronto .
i 'm pregnant .
or stage parents !
oh no . thank you . come on in .
adele ... we got ta do something before early kills someone else .
early didn 't kill nobody , he wouldn 't do that . i don 't know why you 're saying those things . you ain 't my friend .
well dorothy , why don 't you hand me that chili there .
early , sing me a song .
i changed my mind , early . i 'm not gon na climb up that hollywood sign with you ... i decided . i think your mean , and you hurt people .
no sir .
no , it 's all yours . it 's on me ... for saving my ass back there .
he can 't help the way he was raised . i kinda feel sorry for him .
oh , i don 't know ... i think that once i dye my hair blonde , buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan ... i could be veggin ' out with the best of 'em ... like fer shurr !
siesta .
he wasn 't going to shoot her , you murdering son of a bitch !
... you 're hurting me ...
no , but i can tell you he 's not gon na be too happy about this .
i guess so . i got ta stop off home too .
hold up man .
yeah me too .
yeah . do it again .
did they ask you a lot of questions ?
chess tournaments can be boring sometimes . people have a lot of free time . they like to gossip .
you think you 're going to catch him on a trace ? everything he does is planned out well in advance . the only way we 're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up .
i was at the beach .
run it down .
check with the state . if he 's never killed outside of washington the f.b.i . wouldn 't have it . nolan ?
maybe he 's going to drug her ?
find him ! i want to talk to him .
then call them !
so is mine , within the framework of my rules .
thanks .
only in passing . to say hello to .
we 've already met . haven 't we ... doctor .
it doesn 't make sense .
he uses castles ... plural -- then says `` can 't move me . '' singular . not can 't move us .
very good . spoken like a true psychologist . when confronted with the prospect of your own reality , hide behind quotations . what is that masters and johnson ?
no .
let us wish him peace .
that is true .
quick doesn 't mean `` ready '' . and you can 't discuss , we said . right ?
i hate you because you depart without kissing me . that 's all .
ok ... and if it 's you who gets killed ? ... then ? talking about other people 's death is easy , but what about yours ? she 's here ! she moves around you , and can get you in a thousandth of second . because it was your day , your hour , your second ...
of course ! i 'm fine ! i put on your beautiful dress , i slightly made up ... i tried to get beautiful ! don 't you like it ?
if you can 't redo these six hundred miles when you 're rested and ready , how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition ?
that 's enough .
it 'll make it .
p-a-r-k-e-r . right . get on the horn with philly . call me here .
that 's all right isn 't it ?
by car right ?
umm , coalville utah .
it 's mine to risk .
someone should be with you .
maybe you shouldn 't stand in the road like that . you 're pretty drunk .
you do ?
i do . i really do . ok . i have to do some shopping alone . you go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things . don 't hurry and i 'll be back before you to let you in .
be careful .
ok , but remember that they wear it because they have to . i wear it because i want to . that 'll make me look different . let 's get a drink .
they wouldn 't know .
i didn 't know i 'd ever need it again .
sorry . look ... you seem like a nice girl . i 'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money .
i can 't give you that . and if you put me on the stand , i 'll lie .
i know ! you helped me go from a six to a four !
yes .
not really . i know how competitive it all is --
just the love in my heart .
i couldn 't help it ! it was the most fun i 've had since i 've been in law school . not only was i good enough for warner -- i was better than him . he has to see serious i am now . even donovan was impressed , and he 's a total hard-ass .
you guys are so sweet !
you think ?
serious ? ! who the hell does he think he is ? you 're the most popular month on the usc calendar !
so ?
i will ...
wow . i 'm glad i met you .
maybe not to your face ...
where 's warner ?
i gave her my word , warner .
i guess it depends on what you give up on .
hi .
no thanks .
i 'm sorry . i 'm just here to shower .
you 'll have money when you work for it .
absolutely . have him put it on a separate line . at christmas , we 'll pact it so full of lights , we 'll make god wear sunglasses .
check the permits . it was built as a guesthouse . it 's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated .
we have it on video ! was that when ? my parents were down for his sixth birthday ! i remember that .
no , i 'm ... thanks . i took something .
do you like red ?
hell with him . it ain 't that .
he 's right , gibson . put down the gun and we 'll work this out .
i was hoping you were gon na say an engagement ring , claude .
why are you always talking about we ? there is no we . there is a me , there is a you . but there is no we between us .
new york 's a long way 's off . let 's just keep moving , okay ?
he 'd be doing me a favor . i 'm getting outta here one way or the other ! goddamn rats and shit ! fuck !
how the fuck are we gon na do that , ray ? !
so , blocker , what do you think of our boy ?
grandma dodi 's pork rib joint .
you heard what the man said ! move it !
hey , ray ...
i seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up . them fellas sizzled up good . looked like some shit from the x- files . damn , that shit 's nasty .
hell , no ! i just got something in my eye .
what were they , bootleggers ?
excuse me , sheriff . as we explained to your associate here , there 's been a mistake . we didn 't kill anybody . now , as for the bootlegging , we happen to work for a very important man in new york .
shoot him , wilkins !
hey , that 's dad 's throne ! how did adrian get that ? is dad okay ?
i was going to let you out , eventually , cassius . i swear .
weed lowers the body temperature . i read that ... in , uh ... er , science magazine .
you want a queen ? got one right here .
yeah , you do ...
it would be so okay .
you 're already there ...
i can 't screw . i can 't screw .
got ya . is it okay if i do the sleep thing ?
maybe you love her . but what do i know ? i 'm baked out of my mind .
oh , and don 't forget , you 're shoving a pineapple up hitler 's ass at four o'clock .
what are you gon na do ? look at me , nicky ! i got no legs , i got no hips , i got one ear ...
i can 't hear you , nicky . i can 't hear anything !
i will , dad . but in the words of motley crue , this will always be my ... home sweet home ...
you 're the spawn of satan . you got it in you .
dude , it 's us . let us in .
`` mister crowley , what 's inside of your head ... ''
sir , i would prefer if you didn 't raise your voice . it 's making my muscles tighten .
turn this way . no , no ... not you ... you !
of course not ! i 'm curious , not sick .
what an old , old man you 're getting to be , francis . weren 't you ever a yellow ? i bet you were even wilder than -- come on , sandman .
come on . i don 't want to miss the filing-in . there 'll be some i know tonight , i think ...
it could be ...
i promise . we 'll go on as soon as it 's light .
you don 't seem quite sure , jessica . can you do it ? will you ?
this is our bedroom .
or something .
why would anyone do something like this ?
whatever you say , mr. eddy .
all right , all right . keep quiet .
all the conveniences for the condemned , if you ask me .
not for me , thanks . no , i 'm too weary .
thank you .
i can 't let him go alone . it 's suicide !
come on ! we 'll burn the hangar . that will make light for them !
right , bob .
aha - very good , freshie . [ 3 ] very good . you 'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later .
george . george - do you mind ? i 'm sorry , but i can 't talk about it tonight .
i don 't see that there 's anything to say .
i don 't believe it ! i can 't believe it . she 's lying . you 're lying . you 're lying ! every word you 've been saying is a lie ! come on , say it !
there 's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us , but we must go on . come on .
where are we going ? huh ?
well , mr. conway , for a man who is supposed to be a leader , your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing .
oh , you mean my pigeons .
we didn 't get much information out of him , did we bob ?
let 's see ... that was second gear..kay shifts into third . jay winces .
well , if the bugs have hatched , and they 're not here ... then where are they ?
kay . seriously . what if he actually means what he says ?
actually , you may have .
scientific american ? really ?
may i have a look ?
but , unfortunately , you 're even less attracted to guys you 've never seen before .
don 't tell me . insects .
i know ... i do , too ...
on account of those are not his eyes . he had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners .
so she cleaned up . where is she now ?
i 'm saying the third prevision wasn 't there . and that 's not all . i spent a few hours down there and it turns out there 's a dozen more cases with missing previsions .
i 'm fine , lamar .
case # 1108 , previsualized by the precogs and recorded on holoshpere by precrime 's q-stacks . my fellow witnesses for case # 1108 are dr. katherine james and chief justice frank pollard .
your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office ...
yes , it is .
wally . this is danny witwer . he 's from justice and we 're to give him a full run of the farm .
did i ? i don 't recall ... i got lots of kids from that place --
i put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay .
i 'm ... not ... a ... killer .
sometimes in order to see the light , you have to risk the dark .
you look great .
i don 't want john anderton hurt .
knott !
i left him because every time i looked at him , i saw my son . every time i got close to him , i smelled my little boy . that 's why i left him . and now you can leave .
somebody 's getting comfortable .
don 't get my hopes up . if i quit , what then ? i can 't go through this again .
good morning .
no , man , that 's fine . just put that you took delivery .
so , you must be the red dragon .
he had it coming .
i 'll take your goddam bet .
lem me tell you about history : black history . you listening ?
i 'm sure we can . this is a new sister , sister betty .
mr. x , i won 't make you out a liar .
if you want to tell me .
let me explain . no . i 'll do better than that . i 'll show it to you . scientifically . but it 's demonstration purely in the interest of science , you understand ?
betty it 's me . it 's me .
you heard the sergeant . outside .
it 's a little late .
different door . not far from here .
white lie . i didn 't have a family . but i did have two kids . they 're adults now .
no , you 're right . you were hired to protect her , that 's enough . i 'm confident you 'll do that .
yeah ? and if she was ugly ?
well , think about going to sleep . good night , baby .
[ he sounded strong to me . stronger than we are . ]
[ we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings , including the little girl . the same man 'the dreamer ' . listen to this . ]
[ and left three more dead men . ]
[ i should start going for your tits first . ]
oh , i couldn 't eat nothing . my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws .
catherine , don 't make an opera outta this . the three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms . you are an old goat , and she has an italian temper . she is a good girl , but you drive her crazy . catherine , you are no fool . you know this is no good , an old woman living with a husband and wife . two women inna same kitchen , anna house burns down .
thank you .
sure .
well , i bumped into her on the street , and she was as big as a barrel .
sure .
oh man , you shoulda come with us last night , marty . that one for you was a real lunatic . how 'd you make out ?
siddown , thomas , siddown .
sure , sure .
i don 't care about the intention . i just know your cross action is a plus on our side . i 've seen it come through four times .
didn 't recognize you , red . when you get the clamp all the way down , open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery .
just one for a start .
i have been in this army a long time . i know just what you guys are up to . but there are limits ...
there 's only one way .
or her figger .
that 's okay . live a little , learn a little .
way we hear it , the pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in wayne county .
call dago red .
yeah , if i can .
plus running the opium concession for the whole eighth army .
like the spearchucker said , that 's possible . anyway , it 's been an interesting association .
you betcher ass , general .
i like an olive .
he 's trapper john ! only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies ' can of a boston and maine railroad car ! when the conductor caught him in there with his winter carnival date , she screamed : 'he trapped me ! ' what have you been doing since those days , trapper ?
an eternal damnation .
and all the angels are built like lieutenant dish .
so let 's haul ass , sergeant .
not necessarily .
homosexuality .
i don 't think so either .
there 's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another .
i used to throw the javelin .
i been out of action since i got over here five months ago .
it 's a technique ugly john and i worked out in case something like this came up .
how do you do .
well , don 't say anything at all . just sit down .
go on , go on , go on . and we 'll be at jim 's bar up the street .
yeah ? well , you can have it !
i seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account !
you bet i will ! as fast as i can ! gon na get some canned goodsa fishing rod , and the rest i 'm gon na give away .
uh-huh . that 's exactly what i thought . beany , go on down to the office , tell pop to give you the speech . there 's a copy on my desk .
shut up ! if you weren 't drunk i 'd
say , let 's get something straight here . i don 't want any part of this thing . if you 've got an idea i 'm going around lecturing to people , why you 're crazy ! baseball 's my racket , and i 'm sticking to it . come on , colonel , let 's get out of here .
you can 't help me , man .
then where 's my fucking car !
i 'll give you something .
sorry ... habit .
i appreciate your concern . let 's leave it at that .
who cares what you think . i want you back and that 's all that matters .
in europe women find older men very sexy .
no ...
sorry , i just design the maze . keeping the keys secure is your job .
-- katie .
her ?
... perhaps there is a way ... i have heard tales of another power .
ah ... sure .
hey , nobody enters the command center without a power coin !
a stellar idea , skull .
you want me to place a few calls ?
so they 've been destroyed ?
from now on it 's e-v-i-l , no exceptions !
why ya always got ta go lookin ' for a gift in the mouth of the horse ?
ya mean we 're so rich we 're broke ?
you must be feeling better , if you 're looking for sex again .
without us , masseria don 't stand a chance , and he knows it .
a mother-fuckin ' peace conference .
you 're fuckin ' crazy . you 're all fuckin ' crazy !
kool-aid ! ? but who 'd would want to -
y'see , stu , as i understand it , you made this pact with your sister ... no life support ?
you set me up ! !
baby ? why don 't you just ... rest on the sofa for a minute . i 'll be right back .
i had to park two blocks away . is something -
he called me `` doc . ''
i 've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what 's his name ?
sorry , kitty ! i 'll be right back after i choke my monkey .
don 't joke around , little buddy . i mean it . i really do love y --
that 's new york . it looks rundown , but it 's safe during the day . you 'll get used to it .
oh , it 's so nice to meet you .
... manly ?
for instance , how to run the affairs of government ? no doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me -- with the greatest ease !
why , i think it 's very sweet of the children --
excellent ! excellent ! my boy , i 'm convinced our state has a great debt of gratitude to you --
why , of course .
oh , i couldn 't tonight . thanks a lot .
yes -- i think maybe you 'd better .
if you thought as much of being honest -- as you do of being smart -- !
goodnight , senator --
well -- i can *manage* --
here , i 'll take a dozen of those things . miss paine .
listen , joe -- at least -- after a day like this -- i got one good bust coming before i start showing him monuments --
your honor !
no ! i resigned last week !
i 'm not worrying any more . i suppose they 'll go on writing them till they get tired . you don 't believe all that stuff , do you ?
hello .
have lunch .
hello . . .
they are ? i forgot all about them . what do you think they want ?
i 'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on , that you 'll be right down .
oh , yes , i heard you all right . $ 20,000,000 . that 's quite a lot , isn 't it ?
buffer ?
only common sense .
they can have the estate .
i 'm kind of nervous . i 've never been away from mandrake falls in my life . kind of like to see grant 's tomb , though .
you have no pants , sir .
generally that doesn 't work out so well . it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change .
a friend ?
it could happen . what about his state certification exams ? the records seem to be in order .
oh , for god 's sake , phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man ! are we listening to lionel now ?
are we ?
what ? !
there 's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you . i 'm embarrassed to have --
what ?
it 's a pretty piece of land .
-- go on !
yeah . guy 's got some serious sex fantasies .
holy shit !
yep .
you always did have more balls than brains .
perhaps .
according to the ancients , cat 's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld . imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated , and then he will fear nothing .
for them to protect it like this , you just know there 's got to be treasure down there .
yeah , i 'm not leavin , this fort for nothin ' .
yeah , get me a glass of bourbon , a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser .
who cares ? i don 't see no treasure .
quarried granite with a cobalt lining .
you dream about dead guys ?
very slowly .
my dear , sweet , baby sister , i 'll have you know , that at this moment my career is on a high note .
and when those dirty yanks go to sleep -- no offense .
i 'm his daughter .
or even what it looks like .
well , i give to the united way , and i feel that sort of covers --
yes .
he is in love . his anger is gone .
but look at him ... and look at us .
then maybe it 's time for us to form our own brotherhood ... a brotherhood of righteous , crime fighting , skull cracking , disco boy bashing , warriors of the night !
oh shut up .
crime was rampant . it wasn 't safe to stay in your home .
let me see it .
yes , sir , i had the honor of meeting them on the trip from paris .
oh , my darling . i 'm sorry , too . i won 't do that again -- whatever you do . i won 't cause you any more embarrassment , i promise .
you are much younger , and much more handsome , than your pictures .
it will scarcely be considered credible , perhaps , but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together .
passed out ? can 't hang , huh ? boy , i knew you was a lightweight . passed out on one funky ass blunt . they don 't make 'em like they used to , baby .
i know , that 's when uncle elroy cussed out everybody , and threw up in aunt faye 's backseat .
have you seen day-day ?
come on .
yeah , it was . how you get up here ?
are you out your mind ? i 'm not messing with them s.a. 's boy . you must be crazy .
don 't worry 'bout nothin ' , big bro . he in the best fuckin ' hands in rancho chocomunga , baby ! this my world , you just a nigga late paying rent . ain 't that right , nephew ?
well , craig , you 're welcome anytime .
oooh , ba-by !
it 's an important speech .
come on , el , you 're a trooper . i 'll get you some pepto , you 'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person , then back to sacramento . this is no time to lay down on the job . i don 't care what the polls say , you can 't afford to relax . look what happened to bush . tell you what , if you want to blow off the sacramento speech , fine . but do this one and we 'll get out of the smog .
you wouldn 't ...
my daddy is going to be a hero ? like power rangers ?
come with me , honey .
go ahead , sugar die .
they hid in a broom closet !
so you ain 't with the state no more ?
'night miss jenny ; don 't let the bedbugs bite .
is that all ?
yonder .
miz jenny ! miz jenny !
what 's wrong , john ?
glen . not now . i mean , we 're here for tina now , not for ourselves .
deal .
i do want to know . he 's not dead and gone -- he 's after me and if i sleep he 'll get me ! i 've got to know !
proof he 's declawed . as for him , we buried him good and deep .
rod and i are done . he 's too much of a maniac .
i don 't want to go to siberia .
all right , let 's uphold it for another ten minutes .
that 's right .
i can tell you exactly .
how nicely you 've fixed the table , ninotchka .
which part of the room is mine ?
i think i need my glasses .
who gave you this idea ? what is responsible for all this ?
well , gentlemen , how about my proposition ?
leon ... leonitchka ... why are you so good to us ?
shall i draw your bath , sir ?
certainly .
it is thursday !
we avoided luxury and extravagance and today ... well , if you were to offer us a glass of champagne , we wouldn 't say no .
no , no .
brave ... that 's right .
just three people in a room this size ? whew !
au revoir .
go ahead .
thank you . i 've had all the calories necessary for today .
there have been cases ... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast . to us , ninotchka !
no ... please ...
dear me ... i must be losing my finesse . if i 'm not careful i 'll be understood by everybody .
no ... i can do this because i 've spent my whole career building anti communist credentials .
well , no place where they speak english . that way he can always say he was misquoted .
and what am i supposed to do ? just sit here and watch them coming closer ? eating their way to the center ? lyndon bugged ! so did kennedy ! fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano . christ , even ike had a mistress ! what 's so special about me ? what about lyndon ? he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down . did anyone talk to him ?
and if i stay ?
evidently to install bugs and photograph documents .
what do you mean , sir ?
i , unlike senator kennedy , have a plan to end the war . but not for peace at any price , but peace with honor !
because he didn 't even know about it . the cia never told him , they just kept it going . it was like ... it had a life of its own . like ... a kind of `` beast '' that doesn 't even know it exists . it just eats people when it doesn 't need 'em anymore . two days after the bay of pigs , kennedy called me in . he reamed my ass ...
they had us bugged . christ , he had everybody bugged . yeah , he was gon na support me in '68 , but he was also threatening me . that was hoover : he 'd give you the carrot , but he 'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass .
wait till the mai-tais wear off .
let him finish , bob .
this could be it ... this could be it . four long years ...
he 'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain .
i 'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her . anything but a talk with her .
yes ...
turn this crap off , clyde . it 's giving me a headache ... you may go , joaquin .
i 'm trying to spare you an embarrassment . johnny roselli is on his way back here .
no one understands ! -- even my own men . what do you think the communists respond to ? honesty , liberal guilt , soul-wringing crap , fathers on tv crying ? hell no ! i understand the communist mind , i 've studied it for thirty years . they grasp `` realpolitik '' better than any of us , right , henry ?
sure , i 'd like to offer condolences .
that man up there lived in similar times . he had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... sometimes i go to the lincoln room at the white house and just pray . you know , the liberals act like idealism belongs to them , but it 's not true . my family went republican because lincoln freed the slaves . my grandmother was an abolitionist . it was quakers who founded whittier , my hometown , to abolish slavery . they were conservative bible folk , but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... forty years ago i was looking , as you are now , for answers . but you know , ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities , feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have , finding a meaning to this life ...
but change always comes slowly . i 've withdrawn more than half the troops . i 'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years . i want an all-volunteer army . but it 's also a question of american credibility , our position in the world ...
oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome .
yes , i understand that .
the hell with 'em .
gentlemen , i go now to discover the exact length , width and depth of the shaft .
if i stop ... there 'll be no more talk of divorce ?
brezhnev 's coming in three days . i don 't want to deal with them . and him . and you .
well enough . you 're looking `` happy , '' nelson .
i don 't know . he ought to ...
yes . things fall into place .
i see .
yessir . i understand that .
too late . i spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it i just sort of blew it in .
no , just stand there ... lem me look at you a minute .
... to see you .
what 's so special about it ?
it 's not really a good time , guys ...
hi , i 'm betty . i 'll take a miller , if you got it ...
man , that is love .
you 're a hundred percent right . they rely on what's-his-name 's arm too much ...
ahh ... my wife 's .
actually , i scalped him , and then you killed him .
well , then , did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband ?
i said forget it !
then do as you 're told . get her back .
i wish i could help you , but i can 't .
no doubt , brother - i figured as much back there in the restaurant . that 's why i invited you out here for this advanced tutorial .
yeah , let 's negotiate 'em , everett .
pull over , everett - let 's give that colored boy a lift .
caintcha see it everett ! them sigh- reens did this to pete ! they loved him up an ' turned him into a horney- toad !
well now pappy i wouldn 't put it that strong ...
well that hardly sounds like you ...
wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit ? since we been followin ' your lead we got nothin ' but trouble ! i gotten this close to bein ' strung up , n'consumed in a fire , 'n whipped no end , 'n sunstroked , 'n soggied -
no , this is gon na work ! i just got ta get close enough to talk to her . takin ' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named waldrip . i 'm goddamn bona fide . i 've got the answers !
naw . that 's over with .
stop eyeballing me , mayo , or you 're out !
i said , come here !
what are you tired from ?
when i 'm good and ready .
yeah , then if i get jets , it 's on to beeville , texas .
who 's got two bucks ? it 's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old lady and my kids in that motel .
yeah . all week long .
sure it is , sweet pea , but he should 've warned you 'scuzzy ' female types about the 'puget dudes . ' they 'll tell you they 're wearing a rubber but they 've bit a little hole in the end .
naw .
it 's not her fault , it 's not her fault , the guy must have called them . look , look , look , she 's telling us .
okay , fuckball , you think . what are we gon na do ?
lookin ' doubtful there , big guy , but ten out of ten for attitude .
oh , that phone call ...
evan , i am so sorry , you were a saint to wait for us !
he 's talking about bernard pearlstine .
it 's just the woman and the kid ?
they mean , pig ! , that the black panther party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons . we are going to shoot you ! ! !
well as the rev says , god helps those who help themselves . we 'll be our own stoplight .
you know that 's bullshit .
n ... n ... ... not ... oh .
they were empty ...
you fit the profile , brother . you look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust ...
chickenshits , they 're grabbing at anything .
and who is we ?
his journals , letters , maps , books ...
i 'll leave in the morning with gabriel .
she said that ? oh , my lord , she said that ?
i 'm not my mother . i can 't have the respect without the knowing .
as you did at fort wilderness ?
harry , harry , harry ...
for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health , 'til death do they part .
he can if he wants to . he can do anything , just like inspector gadget on tv . but i have to keep things ready for him , that 's what i think . i 've got his picture and i 'm going to sit in his chair --
well , it 's always better to take precautions -- but i 'm sure church will be all right , honey ...
cause i had a bad dream about him . i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr. crandall buried him in the pet sematary .
i hate that smell .
that 's enough , ellen .
same here . come over and visit when you get the chance .
jud , do you remember the name of the student that died on louis 's first day at work ? the one that was hit by a car ?
me neither . but i believe in knowing your enemy .
the door must not be opened . the barrier must not be crossed . don 't go on , doc . no matter how much you feel you have to . there 's more power here than you know .
and church will be fine .
he didn 't waste it .
what 're you suggesting ?
or you could surrender .
captain barbossa ... i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal .
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness .
yes , i 'm all right , i 'm fine ! go capture him .
it won 't . it won 't , and so we won 't .
yes , the rum is gone .
how did he get off the island ?
better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate .
barbossa .
my apologies , governor .
no .
does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb ?
if you 'd like , we can go straight to the authorities . i understand they are very interested in talking to you .
the only history i 'm gon na write is your obituary !
yeah , i 'm going to finish what you started --
that 's right . and making me was the biggest mistake you ever made !
cleaned up ? it can 't be cleaned up ! without the nanobot the waste can 't be stabilized ! that 's what we 've been trying to tell you ! the only thing we can do is run ! run ! run !
look , john , nobody wants to find out what happens . that 's why you 're here . we need your help on this one and that 's why that suitcase is here .
in the meantime , why don 't you find something useful for dr . bright to do .
shut up and do it !
i want trix ! mommy !
and if we evacuate , what do you want to do with o'brien ?
i can 't help it , suze . it 's this place . you know how i get in these stores . they freak me out . all these tiny boxes , little cans filled with eight syllable god knows what .
you 're the doctor .
we don 't have time to argue , susan .
just one question . since dr. argon no longer has feeling below his waist , how is it that you 're still able to do your job ?
yes - sing sing .
oh , thank you , i knew you 'd understand .
i 'm not interested . smythe will open the door .
well , you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide . there is something you can do for me , miss schuyler .
i 'm afraid she 's right , mrs. schuyler . i 'm really very sorry , mrs. schuyler , that you feel this way . i was in hopes that you would like me . i 'm not the burglar that you think i am . after all , we 're married . i think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - mother .
i 'm glad .
little - couldn 't be an automobile , could it ? well , well ! ain 't that nice !
gallagher ?
baloney ! joe ! bring me a special !
i hope not . . . i 've got to call on her this morning !
i didn 't run away .
cut that out . just because i 'm married - there 's no reason for that .
yes - and i 'd love it .
haven 't i covered some territory ? it feels like i 've been on a cook 's tour [ 18 ] some place .
huh ? oh , i 'm not worrying about her - i 'm worrying about that second act curtain , that 's all .
we admit nothing . however , i have a little statement all prepared .
that 's putting it crudely , but
oh , so you did give her ten thousand dollars , eh ? and there are letters ...
well , gallagher , you certainly took no chances , did you ?
no , i ... i was just ... worried about her .
well `` gee whizz '' biff . i sure am glad you asked me .
i thought the books were blank ?
forget it jen , i 've waited a year for this .
gee whiz `` bud '' , what could we possibly need when we have each other ?
sure .
honestly ... no .
easy . mr. jenkins . what job did mr. jenkins have ?
but you don 't know how long i 've been looking for someone like you .
you 're gon na keep painting aren 't you ?
i 'm gon na call you back .
are you guys hurt ?
ok .
that 's fine .
ever since his unfortunate death , there 's been a surge of interest in his work . i 'll use the profits to restore charenton to her former glory .
i think she 's sweet on him , that 's what i think .
not now , or we 're both done for .
don 't come any closer , abbe . god 's watching .
do i have your word ?
whores and pederasts ? you 're better off without them .
valcour . his chair .
we inspected the body , marquis . she died a virgin .
playing dress-up with cretins ? that sounds like a symptom of madness ; not its cure .
stop , i beg you ! have pity , i say ! you 're not my lover ; you 're a monstrous rou !
it 's because of the marquis , isn 't it ?
i don 't believe it !
am i a cursed woman , doctor ? must i be betrayed by every man i meet --
over at rko ?
we 're not all hopped up on benzedrine , orson i some of us humans need sleep !
no , baby , those are the hands of a killer
to my invaluable comrade drink up !
no , i can 't wait . you know when i wait ? when it 's important to wait . it 's not important to wait for no steak . it 's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring . it ain 't important to wait for no steak ! i won that fight . so , i stayed in the ring , and that way i made sure everybody knew it . i shoulda knocked him out earlier , sonofabitch .
stop it . what 're you , crazy ?
why did they have to stop it ? why did they have to stop it ?
you 're not only an animal , you 're a stupid animal . you 're rotten . rotten . rotten . you 're a sick maniac . a maniac ! you belong in a mental hospital .
namely ?
when the lock is broken -- yes .
didn 't you take it to the crime lab ?
if that ring checks out , we 'll give him an escort . so long .
it crashed , didn 't it ?
that 's fine , stella . now would you make me a sandwich ?
there 's something buried there .
you don 't say ! i might just take that compliment as an insult .
hasn 't been any big demand for tickets .
i think it 's enchanting .
ever get shot at , run over , sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera ?
it could be -- the knife , and the saw .
no ! it 's nothing ! just nothing ! you always told me to tell the truth . you think you can just turn that off ?
just relax , please relax !
where 's your mother tonight , plato ?
do you hear from him , son ?
plato .
look -- can 't you see i 'm writing ?
what 's the charge ?
no . in the morning .
dad -- answer her -- aren 't you going to stand up for me ?
yes . and so terribly annoying when they cry . i just don 't know what to do when they cry , do you dear ?
i didn 't want to stop .
no !
mmm , baby . and i 'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree ...
thank you .
nick ...
nick don 't talk till nick gets something .
put it on .
i been driving rigs a long time , nick . four , five million miles of road . worked for people who wouldn 't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day . tell 'em i needed sleep , i needed rest , shit , they 'll hire someone else ...
hey ! hey ! there is a powwow safe !
go ! ! !
we 're all outta gifts , boys and girls , but we got charitable donations !
well , it 's kinda a strange time right now . things are kinda -
it 's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy . now granted that 's what `` true blue '' is about , no argument about that .
oh fuck , toby 's that little china girl .
whatever . just throw in your dollar , and let 's move . see what i 'm dealing with here . infants . i 'm fuckin ' dealin ' with infants .
larry , i 'm so scared , would you please hold me .
you could 've asked the cop , if you didn 't just kill him . he talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up .
fuck you , white ! i didn 't create this situation , i 'm just dealin ' with it . you 're acting like a first- year fuckin ' thief . i 'm actin like a professional . they get him , they can get you , they get you , they get closer to me , and that can 't happen . and you , you motherfucker , are looking at me like it 's my fault . i didn 't tell him my name . i didn 't tell him where i was from . i didn 't tell him what i knew better than to tell him . fuck , fifteen minutes ago , you almost told me your name . you , buddy , are stuck in a situation you created . so if you wan na throw bad looks somewhere , throw 'em at a mirror .
enough ! you better start talkin ' to us , asshole , cause we got shit we need to talk about . we 're already freaked out , we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin ' bag on our hip .
there 's a slight difference .
oh that 's really easy for you to say , you 're mr. white . you got ta cool-sounding name . so tell me , mr. white , if you think `` mr . pink '' is no big deal , you wan na trade ?
and look at it this way . how about jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot .
i suppose that 's my fault .
there won 't be any rest of the trip . over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along . so keep your money . you 'll need it for the fare . i 'm fed up with you . i was fed up with you before we started .
hurry up .
like what ?
things get tough next winter , you 'll have somethin ' to wear .
i won 't again .
that ain 't why . i just figure it 's about time to start runnin ' my own life .
you think you 're so slmighty -- smart -- who are you to sit up there and say nobody 's good enough for you , like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
you want to split up ? --
three men on matched roans ?
i don 't care what he thinks .
i was at first . then i was hanging on . are you going far ?
hugh kane .
what , you think i did this to myself ?
not in a thousand years .
yes , it was reported , but never substantiated .
any of them hot ?
just a little rogaine .
second best .
no ! stop it ! it 's not funny . mom might do it ! someone else might die .
aw , mom ! i hate mr. stubbins !
chip , the only cereal i know about is rice krispies .
suspect 's family is headed east on calverton ... .
well , honey , chickadees breed in alaska , you know . no wonder dede 's hungry . it 's a long trip all the way to baltimore .
it 's ok , eugene . i understand ... i 'll go fix breakfast .
amen to that . it 's been a crazy day , hasn 't it ? !
goddamn you ! that 's trespassing !
you 'll pay for this , marvin a. pickles ! i 'm turning your file over to the vice-squad ! ! the prosecution rests , your honor .
misty , if you want to lose weight go ahead , but do it for yourself , not for some boy you barely know .
from what i understand , the eye- witness is a drug user .
thank you .
you come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally i want to know what kind of danger . i want to know where she is .
as a man , you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician .
you 'd love that , jackie . remember that last summer with mother in the berkshires ? you used to help the gardener .
you will have to make all the jokes , because i 'm going to be very serious .
no , not at all , mr. jason .
i wanted to get things clear for jacqueline . let her know --
perhaps
it will be fun meeting gregory every night at the station .
please .
then it is decided . leo and durk and i will make our plans .
it won 't hurt .
oh , no problem . it can wait .
how do you mean ?
basically , yes .
that 's correct . bit of a dilemma , isn 't it ?
i know .
no , but i wanted to . i really wanted to , partially just to piss you off .
i know , but this ... i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex .
did you take your clothes off ?
so will you , someday .
don 't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit . if you want to leave , leave . my life doesn 't stop when you walk out the door , you know what i 'm saying ?
no .
i 'm not going to give you my keys .
make love to me , 'nine ? i want you to make love to me . please , please make love to me .
i want to be able to see us , nick . i ... i 'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts , ok ? is that ok ? i want to be able to see us when we make love , ok ?
ok , rog . see you at ten .
farley is already a tv winner as we shall see . dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene .
isn 't that brad and janet majors sitting down front ? what an ideal couple .
yes . macabre , isn 't it . the blind leading the blind .
the art will start when i play my part as the healer who will steal your heart
who ?
no ... couldn 't i do this later ?
you 're no good
... and an attractive financial prospect for denton .
now set your glass down and get some air into it .
why are you so hostile ? i know you 're frustrated with your life right now , but you can choose not to be so hostile . here .
i don 't know . i wouldn 't know .
the windmill .
goodnight , miles .
miles , maybe it is better if you don 't come to the wedding .
no dad !
yes . they would invade us using only ground tactics . hand to hand combat . they wouldn 't use their technology or fight an airborne battle , because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them .
what do you mean , the horses ?
you got no idea what they were after ?
pleased to meet you , sheriff .
good luck , mal .
well i 'm real happy for you , cobb . but i think i 'll keep looking for mine .
i saw how you 're putting mal johnson straight .
you see that fellow over there in the gray coat ?
who ?
we don 't need a name . we 'll cast an unknown .
difficult . i 'm difficult .
frank , you know as well as i do , living in a fish bowl , the insatiable appetite of the media ...
which means they 're significant . incriminating . perhaps , criminal . she 's hiding her past . she 's hiding her past .
tell me .
me too .
you do ?
i don 't think that 's the way it works , cole .
j. c. penny 's ?
nikes ? what-the-hail you talkin ' about ?
well , why don 't you hold these as evidence in the meantime .
he 's right . nice guitar break .
yeah . our own . i don 't see why we got to go along for the ride .
yeah . sure . i 'm screwing up the song . you 're the one who 's been two beats behind since we kicked it off .
sherry , you gon na create a hysteria ?
why ? listen , it doesn 't matter . i got ta go .
i know what people say , bill . i ... remember , back in high school i worked at my father 's gas station ?
hell , starla . i always regretted that .
yeah . good .
think we should get up a search party , head in there ?
i see . it 's like as if he 's going in a pattern . is that what you 're saying , bill ?
hey , wally . glad you 're here . there was something i wanted to tell you ...
the problem , starla , is , the last person anyone saw her talking to was grant .
brought you munchies .
gold -- digger , huh ?
hey , look !
hot pants , please . i 'm gon na be flying by in about five minutes with smokey on my tail . can you lock it off behind me ?
i 'll keep my eyeballs peeled .
what kind of personnel ?
you have a butler working that floor ?
jack , if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches , then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that . so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace , when it 's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom .
look at that , we didn 't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all . now , do you know anything about that ?
that 's right ! right now !
we have to transport mr. israel to las vegas , time is of the essence . the gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at tahoe international . i 'm sorry , i 'm restricted from disclosing anymore information . return to washington . you 'll be debriefed in the coming days .
well , uh -- damn , alright , so he 's headed in , does that -- where does that leave us ?
hold up , hold up , i 'm getting shots over the scanners , tons of traffic -- jus ' chill for a sec , lem me listen ...
all right .
i did too .
i 'm just trying to understand what 's going on .
absolutely . look at this .
me neither .
call me next week . we 'll talk about it .
right behind you , t.j .
i saw him too . he was silly and obnoxious .
you make your own luck , parker ! get into the middle of things , spend every day pounding the pavement of the city 's mean streets --
hmf-hrr ?
hi , adele .
i 've had an extremely bad day , octavius . a sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures .
ach , theories ! this was first hand , experiential knowledge , the essence of the universe .
i don 't know anymore .
yeah . security .
so long , sefton .
anybody here wan na double their bet ?
forty-five cigarettes . the price has gone up .
look , this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they 're going to take away that stove . so will you let me eat it in peace ?
maybe it 's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh , duke ?
we 're looking at it .
only he ain 't quite finished yet . blondie -- get that smudge pot . tie it to steve 's leg .
you are talking crazy !
raus ! raus ! all of you !
plant it , animal , and grow us a chicken for christmas .
he don 't have to worry . he 'll trade the krauts for a six-burner gas range . maybe a deep freeze too .
curtains would do wonders for this barrack . you will not get them .
wait a second , hoffy . schulz says he 's our best friend . maybe he can give us a little hint .
the guy i want to talk to is sefton . where 's sefton ? you haven 't seen sefton , have you ?
a little weak today .
the germans know where dunbar is .
and how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself ?
russian women prisoners ?
i believe so .
i believe so .
agreed .
i was ordered to by the captain .
when we went to ancient rome for deanna 's promotion , we threw her to the lions , remember ?
what i can 't get out of my mind is the image of rene- my nephew . i just can 't believe he 's gone .
yes . i need to return to the observatory immediately . i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star .
thank you .
aye , sir .
the star 's going to collapse in a matter of minutes .
lursa and b'etor ? this doesn 't make any sense . a renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star , kidnaps geordi and escapes with a pair of klingon renegades . why ? what the hell 's going on ?
message acknowledged . all units will be informed .
`` ... if the captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger . '' i know the book , saavik .
thank you , mr. scott . i 'll try not to take that personally . my friends ... i can 't ask you to go any further . dr. mccoy and i have to do this . the rest of you do not .
aye , sir !
report status !
all right , damn you ! all right ! give me a minute to inform my crew .
i will speak with you alone , kirk .
'beware romulans bearing gifts . ' happy birthday ...
computer . request security procedure and access to project genesis summary .
and almost got tossed out of the academy ...
mistake ? we 're all alone here . they waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this . reliant is supposed to be at our disposal , not vice-versa .
marooned on ceti alpha v. he 's completely mad , admiral . he blames you for the death of his wife ...
there is some pain at first , i am told , and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end . that was what i learned from watching my wife .
spock ?
we 'll beam aboard . alert transporter room --
no promises , mr. scott . on your way .
right on schedule , admiral . just give us your coordinates and we 'll beam you aboard .
i am understandably curious .
raise shields ! energize phasers , stand by to --
the prefix code is 16309 . all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically ; each ship has its own prefix combination code ...
best speed , scotty ...
there is no such regulation .
honors -- hup !
what do you think , spock ?
ah ... the giants .
how will playing cards help ?
from a city ? that doesn 't make sense ... .
the beasties seem happy to see you , doctor . i hope you like our little aquarium .
millions ?
data , if you were following the boy and discovered this ship ...
i just ... haven 't gotten around to it yet .
by now the son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do .
i 'll be here .
the `` mighty '' federation could learn a few things from this village ...
another time .
i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation ...
i know what data means to starfleet , jean-luc ... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet ...
we 'd have to tag every one of them ... that would take time ... and we don 't have it . the enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the federation ...
we 'll skip the court martial this time ... picard out .
you have two days to become experts ... mister worf , your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture data .
bag him .
i 'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments . if they move any closer to the brain , we could be looking at a hemorrhage .
a universe of sensation is waiting for you ... don 't you want to explore it ... with me ?
and i need to control this ship . let me into your mind .
ready quantum torpedo .
today is march second , 2063 . the time in montana is oh-eight-forty- five .
but how ?
let 's go .
there should be some kind of manual release ...
one minute to warp threshold ...
aye , sir .
they did it ... they assimilated earth .
incoming message from the starship intrepid . admiral hayes .
assign another team if you need to . i want to re-establish communication with the captain as soon as possible .
we 'll have to assume they 've been assimilated into the collective .
we have to cover both possibilities . we 'll take care of the bridge . worf , take your men and seal off main engineering . turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in .
do we have any idea how many borg we 're dealing with ?
deflector dish ... why the deflector dish ... ?
captain , i 've scanned the planet . the atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane , carbon monoxide and fluorine . the oceans have been chemically altered , as well .
what kind of message ?
we were beginning to hit our stride together , doctor ...
suppose he 's holding a grudge ?
aye , sir ; thrusters ...
she programmed the torpedo hits ?
anything else you want to tell me ?
there 's got ta be a way out of this place ...
far be it for me to dispute my first officer . starfleet has always -
i 'm going to sleep it off . let me know if there 's some other way we can screw up tonight .
i 'm going aboard . spock , you have the conn .
you can 't prove any of this ...
i 've already addressed that question , mr. scott . we 'll e able to follow the captain 's movements .
how do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice ?
mr. scott , any progress on repairing our warp drive ?
i was taken from my homeworld by people called the `` pakjeds . '' they are fat . they traded me to a ship belonging to the `` bolians . '' the `` bolians '' are blue . they put me in a seat and asked me questions . then they were attacked by another ship ...
i wish i could believe that , doctor .
i 'm counting on it ... we 've been ordered to head to sector 3274 . starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there .
captain , i don 't recommend transporting , that ion storm doesn 't look very neighborly . -it could head this way with- out much warning .
emergency force fields are holding .
what do we know about the population ?
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack ?
aye , sir .
patience . diplomacy is a very exacting occupation . we can wait .
she 's the most beautiful ship ive ever seen .
praetor shinzon ?
yes .
i understand . thank you .
he doesn 't understand ... just walk away ...
any reports about monsters , people in halloween masks , anything like that ?
it was the husband . the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman .
'we might as well make the best of it . '
iris is dead . she was murdered .
you nervous ? forget it . the cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade , believe me --
hey , iris , you okay ?
why me ?
only way i could stand your ties .
that 's pretty much the way it happened .
sure .
yeah , right , blow it open .
sucks . hey , bobby , turn that up .
maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate what he 's created . it 's the dark end of the street , lenny . how do you like it now ?
i 'm babysitting the dea guys this afternoon , casio and i . you said that was top priority .
that 's the thing . don 't know if it connects , but harold here had a thing about eyes . two of the victims had their eyes gouged out , another punctured . took polaroids after .
just an observer .
murman and imelda had been slipping into a private chat room . low had poor old testa drooling on the keyboard . abduction fantasies , voyeurism , mutilation , teasing him with fetish elements . he is very good . i think it 's safe to say richard low is murman .
i want to protect the boy . i also want to protect suspect zero -- from you .
i 'll be back .
let 's go someplace private , murman , i have something for you .
you 're money , baby .
why not ? this place is dead anyway .
... i mean , does it have to be `` goofy '' ? i was playing hamlet off-broadway two months ago , for crying out loud ...
well ... you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone 's watching you .
hey , man , you 're not from here . you don 't know how it is . i grew up in l.a ...
sorry . we got knocked out pretty quickly .
don 't listen to him . you call whenever it feels right to you .
our little baby 's growing up ...
like hell i will .
no , i don 't want to give barzini an excuse to start fighting .
he owns the studio . just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book , a best seller . and the main character is a guy just like me . i wouldn 't even have to act , just be myself .
you look good , too .
i 'll make him an offer he can 't refuse .
the don has semi-retired . i 'm running the family business now . so anything you have to say , say it to me .
okay . one minute .
ok forget it , just stay on the phone .
thanks tom .
what guarantees can i give you ? i am the hunted one . i 've missed my chance . you think too highly of me , my friend ... i am not so clever ... all i want if a truce ...
yes please !
okay .
i don 't know why people say this country 's civilised . it isn 't . it 's fucking primitive .
like clark kent . now superman .
i don 't know ! why are you asking me ? how can it take an hour to find an ambulance ?
i don 't think so . come back with me to rome . there 's this great new club . have some drinks , lotta ladies ...
what 's going on ?
he 's not a man , he 's a god .
no glasses .
a real skunk .
the cops and company raise hell they find out .
stick up ?
where is he sir ? right in front of me . what 's he doing ? he 's on the= phone . i don 't fucking know , his stockbroker ! oh shit . got ta go .
the cell , mason .
what 's that ? mason ?
yeah ? i 'm sure a lot more people down in l.a. want a piece of me .
honey , i ... i can 't ... it 's the ...
i had it , a minute ago ...
yes sir . but i didn 't go to lawson to run the bijou , that was ... that was something that just happened . you see , i was involved in an accident in lawson , and i spent some time recovering there .
by all means .
you know , i hate to bring this up , but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money , which i 'm willing to bet none of us has .
pete ...
you bet , honey .
did you put the cover on that cage , mom ?
i think they 'll be all right , honey .
impossible .
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range . in fact , during our christmas count , we recorded ...
i don 't know what good that 'll do . chickens won 't eat .
yeah , and the freeway 's well-lighted , isn 't it , mitch ?
oh , thank you .
well , all right , but ...
birds are not aggressive creatures , miss . they bring beauty to the world . it is mankind , rather , who ...
... insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet . if it weren 't for birds ...
no one called it a war !
that would hardly be possible .
can 't you please finish your drink ?
good .
good morning .
it is a pity .
wait , doctor -- wait ! the child 's fainting .
that 's the way of it , fettes . you bring the lassie to me .
your son , ma'am ? he must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so .
you 're uncommon friendly tonight , toddy . more like the old days .
here , have another glass , macfarlane . i 'll take you home and we 'll be friends again -- now that you know that you 're knox 's man and my friend -- aye , forever .
give me money or i 'll tell the police you murder the `` subjects . ''
no , joseph . i 'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy -- i 'll wager it 's better than the doctor 's .
there 's no scar . corvis made it up .
good thing in a situation like this .
look , i 'll tell you the truth . jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back , she has a license , but i mean ... look at her .
i think we 've all been hearing too much about `` space men . ''
i shouldn 't be at all surprised .
i -- i 'm afraid i can 't -- not right now . can i talk to you later ? . yes , that 'll be fine . 'bye .
oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions . bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon , but he wasn 't in . apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind .
i was only trying to be helpful . he was having difficulty with a problem .
this isn 't a comic book store , right . it 's a bakery .
a big legal war wasn 't going to improve anybody 's situation . we 've all been through enough . besides i was raised better than that . thanks for having us , dad .
sorry , mom . it was a mistake . i thought i saw something out the window . i was reading this horror comic and i guess i go a little carried away ...
no . just that he recovered real quick ... that night when i found him in the rec room , he had already scraped off his bandage . before i put him with the others , i redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good ...
wasn 't enough time . generator was out , what ... ? thirty minutes . takes the bastards an hour , maybe two to absorb somebody .
who you trying to protect , mutherfucker ? i 'm telling you this s.o.b . could be one of them .
... where is everybody ? ! i 'm half frostbit !
we ain 't buying that .
a serum test possibly .
what are you talking ? ! he 's had two months training in those choppers !
can you think of any other tests ?
just keep looking .
i 'm so sorry , kalen .
yes ... thank you .
it 's only a machine .
in a week ... we will never have had this conversation .
i 'm glad .
i will ...
he didn 't either .
i never touched your father ! i swear !
they don 't care about all the things we do right . [ beat ] but they might ... they might care about what we 're doing wrong . [ beat ] that 's what they should come here to look for .
later . i 'll tell you about it later . we got a session to catch now .
it 's sunday .
believe me , i know .
you thought my father was crazy ?
[ beat ] yeah , it is .
listen to me . that 's all i ask .
no . [ beat ] i mean i found out while i was in it that my body 's gon na be found in four days .
i doubt it . [ beat ] i don 't think prison 's so bad you don 't want to remember it ...
[ beat ] thanks .
no , it 's fine . [ beat , swallow ] thanks .
there 's two girls out there that had a chance , they had a chance ... ! and you blew it for 'em . now they 've gotten in some serious trouble , some very serious trouble and for at least part of it , i 'm gon na hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them . i 've got no feelin ' for you . but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat 's ass what happens to them and you 're either gon na tell me every damn thing you know , so there 's a small chance i can actually do them some good , or i 'm gon na be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life . your misery is gon na be my goddamn mission in life . that 's a sincere promise .
the women are armed , hal . this is standard . now you stay calm here . these boys know what they 're doin ' .
it 's okay . i 'm married , too .
you 're a little angle , you are .
alright , alright . i 'm sorry .
you mean you haven 't asked him yet ? for christ sake , thelma , is he your husband or your father ? it 's just two days . for god 's sake , thelma . don 't be a child . just tell him you 're goin ' with me , for cryin ' out loud . tell him i 'm havin ' a nervous breakdown .
yeah !
ready when you are .
alright , louise !
just ignore him .
... in texas ... didn 't it ? that 's what happened ... oh my god .
okay , louise ... it 's okay .
about how fast was i going ?
i believe you .
yeah , right . we 're not gon na get caught .
hitchhikers ? i don 't know -- fifty ... a hundred maybe -- who keeps track ?
call you back .
ah , fuck ya then , you big pussy . what are you , spotting ?
we 're gon na go out tonight . oh , that reminds me , i 've got to call what's- his-face and cancel .
uh , hey buddy . oh boy , am i pissed . you 're not going to believe this -- well , you 'll believe it , there 's no reason not to -- but i just got beeped for emergency surgery . well , um , sorry , but i 'm going to have to bail on you .
nice smokescreen , isn 't it ?
who ?
no time , magda , my show 's starting .
oh , yeah , of course , dear .
okay , just calm down . it 's going to be okay .
you mean he 's not a criminal ?
all right , let 's go .
yeah , sure .
tonight , listening to taylor and acheson , i kept seeing burke and dulles telling me all i had to do was sign on the dotted line . the invasion would succeed . castro would be gone . just like that . easy .
mcnamara 's on his way back here now . we need to pick the right ship . no subs . no armed boarding parties either . we need a little more time to figure this one out .
you mean there 's something more important than votes ? didn 't think i 'd live to see the day , ken .
he 's right . and things are happening too fast . it smells like the bay of pigs all over again .
because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else .
the soviets are in control of the sams . it 's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch .
kids are supposed to get detention .
no . i 'm glad i 'm home .
maybe it 's harder for them to say it than they let on . at the very least , they believe it 's in our best interest . and at the end of the day , they may end up being right .
any problems , you remind them those chains of commands end at one place . me .
have to hope it 's a signal that he 'll back down on the real issue too .
and we can 't purge the chiefs . our invasion talk will look like a bluff . or even that there 's been an attempted coup .
yeah , a good political solution .
zorin must not have gotten instructions . somebody in their foreign ministry 's blown it big-time .
and if this is a move to appease the hard line , then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house .
hey , brooks , come over here . i want you to meet a coupla fellas from denver .
no . no , that 's ray , here . ray , uh ... ray ... little weasel .
good . thank you .
seven .
jimmy looks twice put leo 's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago . and threatened him several times since . president clear moon and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat .
the little walking river . you 're right . this is part of it . so whoever sunk this car didn 't compensate for drought . goddamn .
i see . forgive my cultural ignorance .
she 's your sister ?
i can 't , hoss . i don 't talk to fbi 's .
we 're in there . we 're in there --
it 's not that .
you .
you 'll have mine , cougar . it 'll be where your head used to be .
roger , i 've got it .
cougar , you 're on the ball .
yeah , he 's married -- but then again , he , s not dead .
i 've had enough ... for now .
well , you 'll just have to make do with him .
i didn 't ruin her .
stay where you are . he 's mine . i 'm engaged . i 'm in .
my friend , five minutes from now , you won 't give a shit about the people . fire it up , doc .
it 's not my fault . we hit a memory cap .
we don 't have much choice then , do we ?
beats me . i just work here .
enough for everybody to breathe ?
we sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece !
yeah , well those things are gon na be on our ass every foot of the way , right ?
i was in one . a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree . three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon . wasn 't so damn funny , i can tell you .
that 's the plan .
you got that right .
well , there 's sure as hell nothing to stop us now . everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead .
great . thank you .
i think we wait right here .
me , too .
i don 't care what they 're doing as long as they 're doing it way over there .
they 're tearing down the houses here ! we all got ta get outta here together ! now !
i didn 't do it ! what 's going on ?
they 're working together , too .
you guys do all the odd jobs .
yeah , good ! something to keep them busy . we need a decoy .
i 'm dead . we 're both dead .
absolutely .
sustained .
the testimony will remain in the record . do you wish to cross-examine ?
your honor : i imagine that , no matter how careful my questioning , mr. ortega would , in his well-intentioned way , dig my client 's hole even deeper .
what about entrapment ?
not necessarily ...
didn 't this `` information '' come from the joe boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you shu kai kim , a korean , an outsider ?
-- remember ?
... an hour . that 's why i thought the morgue was on the other side of town .
but i like that theory . and since i 'm not putting twerp professor on the stand , and since i don 't have a better theory , i 'm sticking with that theory . meantime i want pictures of the joes . what 'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like shu to fool the eyewitnesses !
nothing has . but that 's all changing .
calls for speculation .
badgering .
objection .
i was right behind you , but you 're too dumb to turn around . if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down .
that 's right . that 's the best coffee you 're gon na get around here .
oh .
albert , why tylenol ?
i don 't take it , sam . i give it .
faster and faster . for a long time you wouldn 't feel anything . then you would burst into fire ... forever .
got ta go , donna . i 'll call you tomorrow .
but you 're strong laura ... so much stronger than i ... how can i help you ? i can 't . i can 't even go outside .
mom ... what are you wearing ?
oh , leland .
this is serious . mr. benjamin horne 's got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself . sarah , you first .
i 'll rule on that presently . proceed .
don 't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth .
i understand . i went to the bar association . they tell me you 're going to be disbarred .
well ...
i 'm going to see you get that chance .
i don 't want a mistrial .
i feel like i did one time when i was small . awful scared and lonesome ... i 'd wandered off - i 've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me . they found me in a church . i was afraid to go in any place else .
i wonder if they 're going through this too ... ?
it might give us something .
i 'm here to make up a report , not to interfere with the operations you 've set up . you 're still in command . clayton forrester ! i haven 't seen you since oak ridge .
well-l ... how do you do , dr. forrester !
we sell the tamales , enchiladas - hot dogs !
no biggie , really .
rex woke me up . he was fighting .
big truck went right by before you opened the door . life on the fault line .
sure . we 'll do an operation , doctor dylan and doctor julie . we 'll fix him good as new .
yeah , sure .
no .
happily , it all worked out ... this time . bill , take philip below and help him find a bunk .
not a chance . remind them that according to the geneva convention , firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war .
i can show you how to use a slide rule .
i 've seen 'em . i 've seen 'em .
son of a bitch ! !
sir .
yes , i was .
we don 't have no paper bags .
we were . now mr. san pedro sula and i are on our way back to utila , in the morning .
yes , that 's so . but there is not much to destroy .
certainly not . we are here only briefly , in fact , until this evening , when we fly to austin , texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the cia .
she got me an abortion ...
maybe two , three months after juarez . i was visitin ' my cousin , junior train , in savannah , and we were at some kid 's house whose parents were out of town . a girl comes up to me that was real tall , taller than me .
we sure don 't , honey ... get me a mounds ?
he 's just a regular guy't needs help , honey . look at him .
i 'm afraid she is , baby .
let 's get outta here , honey .
okay , honey , i 'll see you later .
i 'll come along .
thanks , darlin ' , i know you got my best interest in mind , and i 'preciate it sincerely . i love you , but i got ta sleep now .
mama , sailor 's in deep trouble here . i just can 't leave him .
yeah , but you got ta know what it 's about , right ? i mean , if you didn 't know what it was about , why were you writing it ?
the candelabras were my gran 's .
i told you . they keep him chained in the basement . come on .
hey , i heard all about it -- the parents , the grandparents , the china town thing -- and i believe you , okay ? that 's why we 're here . now go get dressed .
he 's dead , james . believe me , i know a dead dog when i see one .
most of the time he is , james . some of the time he isn 't . now what do we have here ?
shit , james , you 're hungover . what do you think 's the matter with you ?
no .
maybe i just needed the moment to present itself .
arsonist 's daughter meant something .
ah , wear whatever you want .
i 'm fine , right . fit as a fucking fiddle .
hh-uh . last time i saw it was ...
sure . the keys are on the dresser next to ... to your book .
simple .
really , sara , i ...
you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town , and i 'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood .
kirkhill ? that guy doesn 't know his butt from a rathole . hey , perry !
lindsey ! wait a second --
i don 't know , look around .
seven , eight minute swim each way ... not enough time . look at this ... time i get back you 'll be --
we 're here now . let 's get her done .
happy as hogs in a waller down there , prob'ly .
oh ... chamber runs . uh huh , that 's good . well , hey ... you guys know any songs ?
gim me a break ! coffey , these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench ! trust me ... they 're not speaking russian .
he couldn 't be that dumb . the guy 's a trained killer . bud 's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling one night over laundry duty .
no , dad , it isn 't .
it 's the same thing . goodbye , dear .
but why , claudia ? ... why ?
who knows why they all left ...
and aren 't you pleased ? ... that way you 'll have a new kind of adventure .
late , very late .
you shouldn 't always take me seriously . actually , i 'm used to it by now . first my mother and now my husband ; both of them are like dynamos .
really ! so that you can stuff it with your geraniums .
i 'll go even further and say that her presence here -- i don 't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance .
but for you , what comes first : music or love ?
good . then i 'll meet you there .
if women 's breasts were colored , yours would be blue ...
take it easy , raimondo . why are you getting so impatient ?
yes .
agnes you won 't burn in hell . it 's alright to hate him .
you 're getting out of hand . i don 't know what 's come over you today .
oh , it 's a laugh a line with lennon . anyroad up ... it 's all your fault .
eh , don 't take out me lines .
can 't he ? he 's done it , son !
well , you shouldn 't have had bacon for your breakfast , you cannibal .
don 't be cheeky , i 'll bind him to me with promises . come on , grandad .
well ... if he 's your grandfather , who knows ?
there are no commercial lanes out here . face it , we 're out of range .
i 'll see what i can do .
what is it , i can 't --
no , i want to go in .
take care .
god i 'm hungry .
i think that 's a pretty reasonable request .
the reaction has proceeded too far . the core has begun to melt . engines will overload in 2 minutes , 35 seconds .
yeah , okay . go ahead .
-- and the cooling unit on the other .
right .
well we better do something .
it wouldn 't come .
how do we locate the creature ?
the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out .
at least it can 't get up here now .
i 've got an idea , but you 're not going to like it .
well ... this rock rotates every two hours . the sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes .
sun will be down in a minute .
they 're from a dead civilization ; they 're spores from a tomb . god knows how long they 've been here .
look --
right . fire up all systems .
good . i 'm getting you clear too . let 's just keep the line open .
quit complaining ; we 're in space .
right now let 's keep it closed .
so the next step should be --
then that tomb ... must have been some kind of fertility temple ... where they stored their eggs , and maybe held mating rituals ...
who gets the privilege ?
oh man ...
better tell the boss .
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles .
what 's our weapons situation ?
but ...
couple more seconds !
well ... try the headset .
what ? why ?
then if you won 't get out , i 'll have you thrown out .
couldn 't go on ? you 'll give the performance of your life .
that 's how you met me . in passing .
as soon as the peasants stop pawing her .
heaven help me , i love a psychotic .
you 're in a beehive , pal , didn 't you know ? we 're all busy little bees , full of stings , making honey day and night- - aren 't we , honey ?
i 'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all .
if i haven 't , i 'll find something till you 're normal .
no , eve , i won 't forget ...
i 'd do much more - for a part that good .
i 'm sorry , i didn 't mean to-
i 'm so happy you 're happy .
what are you going to wear ?
not much .
too bad .
i love you , max . i really mean it . i love you . come to the pantry .
-- 'cause i only know four chords --
-- and the fbi confirms -- what more do you need ? --
this ? naw ...
-- what ? --
he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general --
-- go over your sources again --
you handed out the money . maybe there 's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done --
of course -- everything they asked --
like what ?
when was the last time you looked at the facilities here ?
yeah , me too , okay , cool .
you know , i 've never got that shit . what exactly constitutes third base ?
jesus , kevin , rub it in .
i 'm not going .
so let 's say you get there ... what 's uh , third base feel like ?
come on , kevin . vicky 's looking for you .
no shit , i 'm never gon na get laid . how the hell am i gon na become this mr . sensitive man ?
i 'll bet you do , you little horndog , she 's givin ' you fuckin ' stiffies , right ?
yep .
no way .
are you crazy ! ? you know that 's totally impractical . besides , like the bible says ... an eye for an eye ...
rip my face off ? hey , we all make mistakes . hell , i didn 't mean to sleep with you on the first night , especially without a condom . but i did , and now i 'm paying the price .
in an underground club ? i 'd like to see that .
come on . i 'm from new york - the `` shoot me '' state . don 't wait up .
no . we have to try . we 'll figure something out . and if midnight comes before we can get to him , well , then we go together . deal ? shake a paw ?
cure ! ? ha-ha-ha !
i know . i 'm andy mcdermott . terrence 's nephew .
yeah , well if i claw my face off , just pack it in ice , okay ? jesus ... the cops were probably right . my uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him .
that 's what serafine is searching for . without much luck , i 'm afraid . if only we could speak with him . but alas , he 's off in another realm , close to death .
you sure it 's not just 'coz you jerk off too much ?
the adm ! quickly ! where is it ? !
but this is class kid , all the way . what a way to go .
right . little twerp thinks he 's colombo .
oy ... not a road trip . i get wagon sick , you know that .
watch me .
you ! how dare you ? ! stop this car immediately !
young man , i ...
alright , alright , i 'm in a bad mood , okay ?
'cause adult education 's a wonderful thing . you meet a lotta interesting professors . you know , it 's stimulating .
and , alvy ... and then i told her about how i didn 't think you 'd ever really take me seriously , because you don 't think that i 'm smart enough .
tsch , i know . a relationship , i think , is-is like a shark , you know ? it has to constantly move forward or it dies . and i think what we got on our hands is a dead shark .
tell the folks where you are today , donald .
i 'll handle it . i 'll handle it . hi .
we really had a good time .
oh , yes , yes .
why last ?
i love you , you 're a genius .
everybody hates the messenger .
no , it 's not ... fuck fuck fuck fuck .
outstanding . princess ... ?
i wonder how long it takes to get someone you 're stuck on out of your system ? if they 'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
oh ? oh !
now will you get out ?
no !
i have a vague idea .
well , after all , it 's my apartment -- it 's private property -- it 's not a public playground .
yeah .
not particularly .
yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the delta .
the draft of that river might be too shallow on the point .
we ain 't goin ' down the river .
your daughter .
the kid can 't ride sloppy waves .
he didn 't look like he 'd take that sitting down .
23 continued :
134 continued :
that 's why i left , moved to washington . when i met eric i was doing day shoots -- products and fashion , mostly . pretty dull . eric was teaching college , and then he got the job with northland oil . we wanted to stay together , so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography ... and here i am .
bastards took off , though , didn 't they ?
fairbanks is a three-hour flight . i 'll be back by dinnertime .
i 've got an idea . we 'll have to work fast .
my home is here . with you .
yeah . maybe so .

and not even then sometimes .
yeah , let 's check out the low-life .
yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints !
you 've got to stop using that word `` we '' it 's getting kind of scary . right katka ?
no thanks , i think we ought to get going though .
don 't worry , i 'll give you a hand as soon as i can .
i 'm not hungry , really .
ooh , well excuse me .
whatever !

don 't worry . thanks .
it 's perfect , you 've done a great job .

i didn 't get to see what 's on the disks but i can guess . do you want to hear my terms or not .
i insist , it is the least we can do .
oh that 's it ? everything i do is crap !
whatever my life is , i 'm going to be friggin ' sure i 'm never disappointed --
be yourself and i don 't think there is a wrong thing . let jamie take the lead . she 'll let you know what she needs .
landon , honey . there 's nothing more .
good thing .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm not going back to school .

then you remember more than i do .
marty , you haven 't been listening . nobody 's asked me to the dance ... yet .

uh -- yeah . i 'm new here , and i 'm supposed to be in this class .
what 's this all about ?
why ?
ssshhhhh !
we don 't ... .
jesus !
we 're at one and a half miles , so you 're just a little over a mile from where you want to be , wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time , and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can 't do anything to stop you . park the truck at 800 and get in the refri -- the time chamber . just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb ... .the power converter will do the rest .
according to your girlfriend , suzy parker , you and she were at the movies . you went to the restroom and you never came out . obviously , you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp , created by the original operation of the time machine .
well , i got it all planned ... and i 'm taking holly off with me .
how about over here ?
well . i 'm not going to let that stop me .
the creatures ? they attacked you ? they tried to possess you ?
buckaroo , i 've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft .
yeah , but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in 1938 at grover 's mills , new jersey ...
it ? who does ?
figures . anybody seen my scope ?
my name 's , penny ! but who cares ?
a black thermopod here ? on earth ? ! why , john gomez ? why ?
flying to cambodia .
she 's just a damn road hugger , allison . plus the man can drive .
perhaps you and i could get together at some point also . i 'm sorry if that sounds abrupt . i just ... i don 't know anyone here in this town .
bill

all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick . mebbe that 's why i allus have such a powerful thrust .

well i figured that your password was `` finster . '' your pomeranian . and it was . and it 's all very interesting , though a bit on the technical side , i mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it 's gon na be one big giant ...

thank you , alfred . i hope you 'll excuse me . it was a great pleasure meeting you . and you .
vicki , if i say anything cryptic , or ... ambiguous , i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it . because even if it doesn 't sound that way ... that 's how i 'll mean it .
sometimes ... i don 't know if there 's enough of me left to save .
god ! how old are you ? there ain 't no bat .
... behind the makeup ?
miss vale , was it something i said ? do you want to sniff my flower ?

and the , uh , the briefcase ?
huh ? no ! what the fuck are you talking -- i 'm not -- we 're talking about unchecked aggression here --
huh ?
c'mon dude , eventually she 'll get sick of her little game and , you know , wander back --
well , you have your story , i have mine . i say i entrusted the money to you , and you stole it .
stay away from me , mister !
i haven 't forgotten .
you put a bullet in my brain . wouldn 't expect anything else .
either that or feeding the worms .
i wouldn 't worry about it .
you need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches , paco .
as scripted ? you 've already lost two of your own . how many more are you willing to sacrifice ?
us ? what are you talking about ?
just do it , old man .
he will .
for them . but for me --
no problem .
jesus , karen , you 're breaking my heart here --
you 're wrong , dragonetti .
someone who 's sick of living off scraps . the coming age belongs to us , not the humans ! when the final war between our races comes , who do you want leading the charge ?
get away from him !
i 'll take my chances .
only thing i 'm feeling is homicidal .
-- whatever ; that 's her .
-- fuckin ' a right --
anna 's the witch .
at least you still have the tapes .
and what 's your excuse for being here ?
that feels good . lower -- down into my neck .
it won 't ?
if that 's what you want to do , then you oughta do it . you , uh ... you want the bed or the couch ?
what the hell happened , ray ?
... what was that ?
with your gun ? ...
we get a lot of assholes in here , marty .
what 's that ?
aunt barbara . i 'll try not to get depressed .

mom .
... and the winds of destiny carry you aloft ...
that 's where you belong ...
we sell it . i got it all figured out . we make three finger lids and sell them on the beach . we move all of it . we 've made ourselves a hundred bucks . or a lot of weed for our head . what do you think ? not bad , huh ? i got the baggies and everything .

i like fire .
shortly after i arrived at danbury federal correctional institute i related to diego that the crime i was in for was smuggling marijuana . diego told me he had high level connections in colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into america ...
relax . i 've flown with my old man a million times . and he always told me , the taking off part is easy , it 's the landing you 've got to worry about .
cheer up , man . half this money is ours . we 're fucking rich .
you know , he 's got a point . we 're fucking americans . we stick out like sore thumbs .
why , yes , of course ... but for the moment , let 's be satisfied with algiers ! in the mountains our work is always easier .
objection . your honor , we don 't know where this tape is from . who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made .
i was just about to make my point , your honor .
back off , john .
the state 's investigation just uncovered mr. roston yesterday afternoon in chicago .
your honor , i 'm trying to establish a pattern in dr. paley 's behavior with women .
she said she was going to fuck me like i 've never been fucked before .
that 's all dr. paley .
you still haven 't answered my question .
how often do you use cocaine ?
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael .
we have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty .
i 'm sure you haven 't done anything . have some iced tea . how are the kids ?
i don 't mind waiting .
who the hell is lucy delaney ?
maurice , man , shut the fuck up .
saw bones ol ' bones on top of the hill . rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills .
let 's get going . go home , pick up what we need , then crash here .
whatever , let 's just get the hellout of here .
what it will be .
i don 't need to hear the deal . i don 't need any partners . i don 't need new product . and i sure as hell don 't need this motherfucker 's 'mattie in my face .
no brother . i wouldn'ta . i never done a man - any man . let alone a brother like that . course , as you can see , no good deed goes unfucked . now the question is , if the good get fucked , what we got saved up for the bad ? you about to find out .
my god . my dress . we have to find it . and burn it . and shut the door .
you moved into this block ?
can 't be done . that place already died and gone to hell .
look , you guys want to play college radio , high school reunions , and some fool 's club once a week for the rest of your lives , that 's cool . but i think we can do better .
then your father 's a dead man and jimmy bones is gon na be around a long time .
why ? 'cause you know him ?
just hurry .
good boy .
good . sit tight . i 'll call you .
sure , cease . they make us do stupid things , don 't they .
wait a minute . wait a minute . do you have any idea what you are saying ? you are asking me to help you fuck the mob .
c ! shit , i 'm sorry !
you are as radiant as ever , violet .
open it -- -- do it -- what 's he got in there ?
let 's go -- we got to get away from this phone .
no .
david ... in a free society information is the name of the game . you can 't win the game if you 're a man short .
i understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers . people want value for money and a cost-effective service .
no , no ... i did that ...
you 've just said yourself , miss , we 've already stamped it . why should we stamp it twice ?
27156789/074328/k .
here .
no you 're not . jack lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he 's got the ambition . you haven 't got the ambition but luckily you 've got me . and mr helpmann . mr helpmann was very close -
actually , i 've decided ...
fixed ?
why not ? all you 've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it , haven 't you ?
i can 't hold up my head anymore .
strawberry ain 't shit . drug pussy . me . i swing like reggie . mr. october . number three , game six , world series .
it 's not so rare . he grew up on our street . he 's had a rough life and he 's a little crazy from it , but that 's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water .
okay .
he 's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight . then , lord willing , we 'll try to bring him back .
i need a drink , that 's all .
don 't worry , kid . tom 'll take care of you . put your head out the window , get some of that summer air . listen to the music . el toro de oro . andale . pronto .
look out !
relax , will you .
you write this ?
i 'm going to miss you -- you 're a prick in a great way ...
no . it makes me nervous to think about it . let 's do this .
they 're not that dumb , after all .
sit down , stop .
i spent a fortune on this .
it 's started .
no , it 's awful . oh my , it 's awful .
and it has nothing to do with the fact i left your room instead of staying there ?
george weln is at the pentagon where the attack launched by the lone libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might .
i 'm going over to aaron 's . maybe i 'll hoop up with all of you later . how long do you think you 'll be there ?
good . that 's it ... see you .
i 'm not knocking it . it 's a great solution . not only the storage but you can see everything you have .
honest ?
oh ...
carla -
what are you trying to say ?
oh yes ... very nice ... very , very nice ...
leonard , what are you doing ?
here here !
really ?
uh , i can take real good care of myself , mrs. swicker !
well why don 't you clean up this dump !
what 's with you ?
'bye .
jeffrey . projectile vomit .
you guys are thrashed .
buffy .
i don 't actually think jeffrey 's gon na notice .
i 'm sorry . that was impressive . the ... tumbling .
it 's true .
your turn .
i heard she got straight a 's .
buffy ?
we all deserve to wear white .
that 's not necessary , jackson -- - okay , nuke , now lean in for the sign .
oh let 's not ...
you got a live arm there .
shake off the pitch . throw what you wanta .
gim me that .
god damn it i 'm sick of you calling me `` meat '' ! you wanta step outside !
my right .
'cause of ebby calvin laloosh . the big club 's got a hundred grand in him-
i 'm joe riggins . sit down
even if it 's the carolina league -- this is a chance to play everyday .
speeding ?
got a lot of holes in the desert , and a lot of problems are buried in those holes . except you got ta do it right . i mean , you got ta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk . otherwise you 're talkin ' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin ' . and who knows who 's gon na be comin ' along in that time ? before you know it , you got ta dig a few more holes . you could be there all fuckin ' night .
you know , i don 't know if i could do this even if i wanted to . the gaming commission would never give me a license . i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me .
me ? that 's why the bosses sent me out here . they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint . like these two fuckin ' balloon-heads over here [ eddy and jerry ] . they were gon na try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin ' grand ? yeah , right , i 'm sure .
it was so obvious . i mean , all of nicky 's half-assed mechanics , they were real signal happy .
hey , rich .
the coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here , and i mean every little fuckin ' thing too .
come on . there we go . look at that . beautiful .
all right , we 're clear .
thanks a lot .
you do whatever you want . do i keep my promises , or do i keep my promises ?
good evening , everyone , i 'm paige novodor . what should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant tangiers casino executive , sam
i can 't .
if we let her get a few of her things we 'll be out of your hair .
she started it . she started the whole thing . i 'm just standin ' here .
don 't look at me , pal . i got ta live with her .
we 'll hunt him down together ...
it may be time to get the police involved ...
how could i forget . mammoth -- go pet the kitty .
i got her ...
a bit sadistic , don 't you think , captain ... ?
just a homeless woman . wrong place .
you can 't get away with..
men , huh ?
fine , fine , at a later date , i 'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who 's not the creep . but for now , i 'm drilling inside your brains ... i bring up the whole catwoman thing for one reason . i bit captain god in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses -- `` my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.. ''
oh , so now even the keepers of the city don 't meet your standards ... you 're late .
we met on the internet . the captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters . we don 't even know each other 's true identities ...
so theo and nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed . a thing of beauty . jesus , the shit you come up with !
will you relax ? this in no way affects our business . go on .
sure -- and they record your voice . and later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder . that 's out !
who the fuck you kidding ? send me money !
she wants to know , sir , do you like your hair .
he asked me to see were you all right .
let me go , dil
i 'll bear that in mind .
relax -- you 're gaining .
the tooth powder . wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it ?
don 't be a fool ! he 's carson dyle !
no thanks .
what should we give him ?
i admit i moved to paris because i was tired of american provincial ,
as fucking if .
this party is sick .
yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah .
ext . brynner 's van - night .
int . postal van - day .
ext . dam - day .
why do you think mulwray 's body was moved you dimwit ? evelyn mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the oak pass reservoir ?
jake , you 're very disturbed . you 're crazy . that 's her father .
a check ?
we don 't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy . i know you 'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us .
help yourself .
hope so . he 's working for us .
money doesn 't matter to me , mr. gittes .
too bad !
that 's nothing to do with it , it 's the car that 's still being run in ...
well , it 's hard to call an important person by his first name . but if it really matters to you , i'11 call you ... toto ! ...
what does it say there ?
these 'll be kept . i 'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly . i will also provide them -
that 's a long story .
who said anything about brooms ?
i wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

september the ninth ?
mr. kane is finishing your piece the way you started it .
i made miss - miss alexander send you the note . she was a little unwilling at first - but she did it .
i 'd rather mr. kane withdrew without having to get the story published . not that i care about him . but i 'd be better off that way - - and so would you , mrs. kane .
it may not be about anything at all .
too late for what ? too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ? well , you won 't do it , i tell you . you won 't do it !
rogers , i don 't think i will postpone doing something about you until i 'm elected . to start with , i 'll break your neck .
love ! you don 't love anybody ! me or anybody else ! you want to be loved - that 's all you want ! i 'm charles foster kane . whatever you want - just name it and it 's yours ! only love me ! don 't expect me to love you -
won 't you step into my office , mr. thatcher ?
no , that won 't help . besides , you never get drunk . i wanted to talk about you and emily .
that 's the train with all the lights .
so i 'm told .
are you open ?
not yet .
jesus christ , what next ?
because he 's out of shape .
i admit , i can be bought .
don 't say that . you 'll embarrass frank .
i only came back for you .
you know me , i 'm a night person .
i don 't know . here , lay down and get some rest . we 're going to need it .
oh , good . for a minute i thought you 'd lost your mind .
right , all the bullets we can eat .
jessie , i reached the top of the tower . so far , no sign of anyone . looks like a phoney call . over .
half a day .
what the hell are you waiting for , goddammit ! don 't you see what he 's doing ! he 's hijacking the shipment !
hey , you dealt us this hand , we 're playing it all the way . move .
there , there mother , it 's alright . he doesn 't mean it . you were in the papers again , son . it said they had done great wrong to you . it said how the government drove you to try and do yourself in ... and when you think about it , son ... maybe it was our fault too in a way ... your home 's your home when it 's all said and done , son . em sobs .
this is to make sure you stay cured . georgie hits alex in the stomach with his blackjack . then , they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks . after a full minute of this , they drag him out , halt-drowned ,
of course .
... petrov and cicerno for sure ...
no harm done , ma'am .
max never had many friends . so much with the piano . always keeping to himself , it 's unhealthy ...
mom , vincent . vincent , my mother , ida rilke .
an apology .
i 'll deal with it . i will , i will ...
yeah .
we 've both run out of options . if it helps , take comfort in knowing you never had a choice .
makes two of us .
shut the hell up .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
fuck you . i know you 're crazy , but fuck you .
top pocket ... go on .
i don 't know if you 're the best lawyer i 've got or a high school sophomore .
you don 't understand --
no . not yet .
maybe it 'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles .
thank you , mr . sensitive . i 'm coming at this wrong ... missing something ... something ...
because i can 't .
okay .
blue 'll git him , boss . we 'll git that bastid , cool hand luke .
i 'll give you fifty cents .
ah believe i smell me a blonde-haired lady .
back at it in the mornin ' . just need a little nap ...
maybe we oughta call you no-ears . you don 't listen much , do you , boy ?
he 's the champeen hog-gut of this camp . hell , i seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes . he kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails , any damn thing . if you 'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head , he 'd even eat that .
forty-five .
i know he 's got a paira kings . he don 't have to stick 'em in my ear .
hell , no . i ain 't goin ' down in the ditch .
none of your fucking business .
andy ? when a three-year-old says there 's a monster under the bed , you don 't say 'forget it ' . you look under the bad . i 'm three years old . call the prison .
andy ?
stop acting like a silly little fag !
you talked to me . do you remember ?
look . there 's the order : you wrote it : desalvo , bianchi & buono , berkowitz and dahmer . it 's going to be dahmer next . which means he 'll kill a man .
well . another time , then . i 'll be all right . he 's not going to attack me ; what i ' m rally afraid of is all in my own head , ruben .
doped up kids all over town . park was full of them last night . very easy pickin ' . goetz 's type .
you know , m.j. , when i watch you shoot , i realize i 've got a little problem with my stance ... could you just move over here and critique my legs ?
why would he send this to helen hudson ...
i got ta get something to eat , i haven 't eaten all day .
so i 'm maybe gon na lose three good cops ? you fucked up on this occasion , but don 't be so hard on yourself . there 's something i want you to think about . the book says if you use your gun , use it to kill , that 's what it 's meant to do . you tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting , to keep him alive . to what end ? you 're not willing to kill , you can 't be a cop . go get drunk . i am .
we 're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement ...
vaughan isn 't interested in pedestrians .
it 's something we 're all intimately involved in : the reshaping of the human body by modern technology .
where are you ?
we 'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn 't clear in the next how are other things going ?
all i want you to do is think about what 's best for you . really think about it .
really ?
i know . i know .
i 've already made arrangements .
not even if it 's something positive ?
break up ? they wish .
i think you know i 'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap .
yes .
sure , i understand .
that 's so sweet , michael . but , really , i 've so many things to do .
hey , you 're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world . i took a shot . it didn 't work . did you bring the tapes ?
you 're always pointing out my negative qualities . my analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people .
no problem .
we 're leaving . raymond get the bag .
what is that a threat ? are you fuckin ' threatening me , marcel ?
i would have to say ... pretty fuckin ' bad . you gave us the wrong address sophie .
i think he 'd cut his dick off if bastaldi told him to .
she took everything ! didn 't even leave us cab fare .
this is the only american car you 've ever driven .
cool .
he 's right . do you have any idea what van gogh 's `` vase with twelve sunflowers '' is worth ?
zero did not put it in his bag . he put it in yours .
we don 't know that for sure .
thanks .
after last night i could say the same for you .
i do as i please .
really ?
spare your energy . i 'll be back !
that can 't be ! everything has an antithesis ! why not this ?
father ! let me avenge my mother 's death .
annie , i need a file .
i knew that .
i saw it , too .
i should be trying to stop you .
right . you sure i can 't just take you to the emergency ward ?
out . now . i got ta work .
i think he 's yours , now .
and she 'll be alive . up here .
you mean you 'll , like ' dig your way out of the grave ? euww .
i need to find him kind of soon , elly .
fine with me .
is that the last thing you need ? my your clever .
it was perfect .
alright , i believe you . stop crying . your secret 's safe with me .
would you cut the psycho babble bullshit , mom . there 's pictures of me on the internet .
i 'm just taking the poor girl under my wing .
hopefully , though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid .
what ?
i hate it too .
i 'm aware .
that 's exactly what i told mr. reed , but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you , miss callahan .
i know how it is . my dad collects miniature canon .
amy 's been lying again .
i suppose so .
we 've got to go on . amy , here , all this time , you 've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours . now we find you 've only kept it secret .
mommy 's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away .
such a brief visit , but dear child , it has made my christmas very merry .
got more leaf mold now than we 'll ever need , mr. reed . i thought i 'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean .
there is a man 's arm in my bed .
no , last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him . i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed . and my throat hurts .
tell them you 'll meet them outside .
it 's mark .
okay , if you think of anything else , please give us a call .
mark wouldn 't hurt a fly .
what makes you think i was the last one ?
packages of money .
yeah and when we 're mad at each other we 're out of sync . it only works if you 're on good terms .
one of our only leads ... you had dates with both men right before they were killed .
great .
well it 's a last minute change .
oh my gosh ...
he wasn 't always like that , anyway .
he 's just finding another reason for bumpin ' us off . don 't ya see . he needs us ta die . he needs our bodies .
leave me alone , you ... cocksucker ! ! !
sir , tyler is innocent of any crime against the state . captain rhodes is ...
i thought i 'd be spontaneous . i mean , that 's the point of this whole thing , isn 't it ?
what ? !
then don 't tell me how to talk to my father when you 're the same way . all right ? !
hey , would you not worry about your precious little necks ? if they catch me , i 'll tell them i made it up . all your asses are safe . look , gloria and tina didn 't come here to listen to us argue . are we gon na have a meeting or what ?
rahesh non never existed , mr. meeks . you make him or someone like him up . no self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one i received :
`` we went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life . '' anybody want to read ?
but she 's in love with : the moron son of my father 's best friend . what would the dead poets say about that ?
screw it all . i don 't give a damn about any of it .
boat or no boat ... i 'm going ...
i don 't mind him ... but i do think it 's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup .
nothing ... you want to come , come ... you don 't ...

i don 't care if you 've got the good housekeeping seal of approval ... i 'm not looking for company .

he lied to me again .
i did not , grandma .
that 's fair enough , jabez . man 's got a right to mull things over . we 'll drive round again , week or so .
i 'll look out for myself ! ... now go away -- leave me alone .
now look here , ma . i 'm not a boy anymore . i want that understood . i don 't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life . mary 's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
yes , jabez -- don 't worry .
jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us .
married .
we must shut down the building . go wider -- !
this is what this is about ? out building project in indonesia ? contrary to what you people think , we 're going to develop that region ... not 'exploit ' it .
whoa , whoa , easy man . i won 't hurt you . who are you ? what are you looking for ?
i 'm an exceptional thief , mrs. mcclane . and now that i 'm moving up to kidnapping , you should be more polite .
yeah . i remember our first date .
thanks ... partner .

fuck you , sir - if i 'm right , i don 't need you . what i want is - if i make an honest mistake i want help .
why didn 't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street ?
you 're goin ' outside with me . if there 's no cops around , we just split . otherwise , you go with us .
i took too long .
i don 't fool around with you .

it 's my mother . who needs this shit ?
okay . which one goes ?
don 't fuck with me , ed . not you , not tonight .
that bitch called me a bitch .

because i want justice . i want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong . and i want to have a little fun .
just shut up and do what they say . they 're gon na kill us if we don 't , ian .
i wasn 't trying to be a hero . i saw what was about to happen and i reacted , didn 't even think . if i did , i might not have done it in second thought . da mayor is an old man , haven 't run that fast in years .
that 's right .
now that 's more of what we 're looking for .
put some ice on it .
yea !
don 't snap at me like that . you 're lucky i don 't punch you right in the face .
you wouldn 't get it . just a private joke between best friends .
what do you mean ? we can 't go in there or we 'll be `` it '' .
yes . screw george washington . just like marilyn monroe did .
or maybe crossing a river !
i 'm ready .
greater than treasure , usul . we have thousands of such caches . only a few of us know them all . when we have enough ... we shall change the face of arrakis . listen ! ...
usul ... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard ... the fedaykin .
i see the truth of it . -- reverend mother could he be the one ? ... maybe ... but will he be ours to control ? you know when people speak the truth ?
i 've heard enough of my safety ... what about my father ? ... i heard you talking . you speak as if he was dead . well , he isn 't !
i think she 's a honey . look at those jugs .
nonsense ! you look great -- look , uh , why don 't you lie down and take a little nap ? we 'll film around you for a while .
soon , bela ... soon .
no , it 's fine . it 's real ! in actuality , lobo would struggle with that problem every day .
well , i 'd really like to know what you think . why don 't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it ? i 'll wait ...
sure thing , mr. kravitz .
yeah . i know what it 's like to live with a secret , and worry about what people are gon na think of you ... my girlfriend still doesn 't know why her sweaters are always stretched out .
hell , if i did , i wouldn 't have any friends .
here 's to ed . for making us into something .
don 't worry , i 'll teach you .
good luck .
he had a woman in my own bed ! and how dare you call him `` dad '' in front of al . this is your father . this is who was there for you when you needed someone .
i know . i mean i 'm sitting there and her father 's asking me about my `` career prospects '' and i 'm playing `` risk , '' with her kid brother , leon and at dinner the dog 's sniffing at my balls -- at least i hope it was the dog . 'cause her mother disappeared for a while .
no problema . you want a picture ?
thanks ... that 's ...
what happened ? you described this `` crazy-kooky '' family who 'd be a million laughs on tv ?
here , get down .
looks like tim kobza .
look , why don 't we just forget about tammy ? we 'll have the assembly tomorrow , everybody 'll make their speeches , and i 'm sure everything will be fine .
that 's enough , tracy . quit while you 're ahead , okay ? i 'll handle this . could you ask walt to come in ?
that said , the whole point of an election is to choose winners , and that you have done . we 'll begin with president .
would you sign it for me ?
your novel ? are you fucking kidding me ?
why don 't you guys go sit down , okay ? i 'll catch up in a minute ? i want to talk to mr. m. about some important stuff .
it 's a conflict of interest . and paul was first .
okay , paul . thanks . thanks a lot .
that simple , huh ?
the public demands justice , sir . this was a full-fledged riot of policemen . shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured . force them to retire . but someone has to swing . indict , try and convict stensland and bud white . secure them jail time . feed them to the sharks , sir . protect yourself ; protect the department .
i know that , sir . i also know that when he made lieutenant , it was as a detective .
okay . i 'll do it .
a third . i don 't think we can make a case without bud white .
please hold , sergeant ...
why ?
a receiver tuned permanently to the senator 's phone .
hi , dad .
what kind of fossils ?
don 't go over it again , please .
you will . you will .
there you have me .
i was repairing the stairs . i found a library and the books were very useful .
this is what i do . i do this every day .
then come with me .
not at all . i was thoroughly enjoying by book . please . signor d'agostino , herr bermann .
something of great value , something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate ...
look on the back . what do you see ?
we go underwater ?
it 's not a village . there 's nothing there .
no , no , please god , you 're wrong . i 'm a thief . just like you .
hold the record . alone .
my god --
it 's a death mask . death mask means dead .
yeah ? i should learn to do stuff like that . they make the place feel real homey .
not around here . this is a rough part of the world . hard times , not a lot of money , not a lot of luck . it 's a challenge , staying healthy in a town like this . heck , even our dogs up and die .
yeah . isn 't that a shame ?
well i hate it .
no , see -- that 's exactly what those arrogant pg & e fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power , we don 't stand a chance in hell against them . but you know what ? they 're wrong .
how would you know ?
cause it 's my office party . if you had an office , i 'd go to your party .
fine . i 'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon .
outside with the sprinkler . so it 's good ?
barks his right on !
mudhole ? slimy ? my home this is .
go tell your precious princess ... luke is dead unless he shows up soon .
forget it .
i had nothing to do with it . general rieekan thinks it 's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from .
... just remember that , cause i 'll be back ...
i think not . but i don 't wish my prize to be damaged . we 'll test it first . bring in captain solo .
don 't worry about a thing . i 'll get us going .
that sounds familiar .
i understand .
well , what now ?
he 'll survive .
i 've learned so much since then . and i 'll return to finish ... i promise that , master .
utopia became depressed after her mother 's suicide , began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator . she 'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time . somebody else was in there with her .
we 'll see .
i 'd like to get out but i don 't have enough money .
you 're free , plissken . but if you even so much as break wind on a country road i 'll crush you like a bug .
... perceval !
-- by itself it is only a piece of steel . its power comes from he who wields it . for now there is no one . do as i have ordered !
i sought only not to harm you , sir .
only give me leave to ride out again , to do what i am most able to do , and happiest doing .
'help me , help me . ' help me get up .
because you must ! you and only you . have you forgotten that it was you who freed excalibur ?
there are maidens as fair , and fairer than guenevere . if i put my mind to it , i could see them now , many of them , weeping for love of you , watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles . offering you their every favor . rich , clever -- but if it is to be guenevere , so be it .
i didn 't ask for poetry . which is it ?
i can not . i must not . here i must stay .
your mother told you that ?
so be it .
i grant you your wish if you grant lady guenevere hers .
not you , my husband ?
-- it must wait , child . these good ladies , for whom i intervened once , will honor me with a meal . i am beholden to them now as i was when they begged my protection .
i won 't . you would misuse such power . i have paid enough for you , and i will have you .
just show the sword .
of course . have you got a pen ?
if that 's true , then you must know my mother 's maiden name . what is it ?
it 's all there . both nights .
catholics . what do you expect ? oh , well , what 's in a name , right ? let 's go inside and have a look at that cake .

he 's just feeling sorry for himself . this is it , pal . hear me ? two bucks a can .
they never should 've voted against u.s. statehood -- the scumbags . we heard you got wasted .
you 're not holding him right ... caz ...
-- i called , but i 'm not castor . i 'm your husband .
he 'd see that a mile away . the only person he 'd talk to about that bomb is his brother . unfortunately , turnips can 't talk .
just make sure you 're there . on time .
and how much will your `` fun '' net you this time ?
like you know anything about it .
you can 't blame me for trying .
that 'll be a nice little holiday treat .
seven . really .

great minds think alike .

reed . shh . just be quiet . and look up .
same old reed . all analysis , no action . wasn 't that the problem with you two ?
it must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool .
we 'll know -- in the next breath ...
you can 't believe all that 's accidental ? that there isn 't a creative intelligence at work --
take a close look at your soul , and your infinity , and your god out there --
we could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye .
i 'm afraid there 's only one thing we can do . call off the mission .
send the following message ...
let 's hope they realize the danger . captain , i 'll give you a new compass heading .
look at those walls up ahead !
on the repeater .
geez . that 's more'n i 've heard you say all week .

bob is dead , tyler . the police blew a hole in his head . was that part of your plan ?
fuck that , maybe you 're my hallucination .
if only alex and i had done that with the others , alex might still be ...
that 's why death is working backwards . it 's tying up all the loose ends , sealing the rift once and for all this chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie . in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay , it has not been edited .
of course not . that would be irresponsible and unprofessional .
clean up ? i don 't ...
hold on .
yeah , i thought he was supposed to be helpful .
then what 's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean ?
that 's crazy . you can 't give up now . we can still fight this thing .

i --
an eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind . we must stop .
muslim and hindu are the right and left eye of india . no one will be slave , no one master .
not true ! the secret is mastering the urge .
that 's when you take advantage .
i can . but i risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less `` holy '' than mr. baker .
he 's `` discovering '' india .
too late for that . we 're closer to the other side .
i 'm sorry . i think i was crying .
we would like vincent to have a brother ... you know , to play with .
only every time i 'm in here .

hannah , my head is throbbing . hannah you never want to talk about it . i -- every time i bring it up , you- you change the subject . what is it ? do you -- we 're communicating less and less . you sleep with me less and less .
you missed a very dull tv show about auschwitz . more gruesome film clips ... and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions .

i can 't stay on this show . i got ta get some answers . otherwise i 'm telling you , i 'm going to do something drastic .

they wouldn 't be a bit surprised..
you 're all making me blush ...
clever observation . go back to wichita . oh that 's right , you can 't .
oh my gosh , why didn 't you say something earlier ...
that 's okay . your mom said you had a big date . heck , i 'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date .
that 's bullshit . just shoot .
you 're beautiful .
shut up , it is . i told dennis if he gave me another topic that was political , i 'd spew burrito chunks .
never say never .
he used a real gun . they should throw his ass in jail .
well , you better move holden out of the way or he 's going to get spewed .
oh sure , pilgrims , indians , tater tots ; it 's a real party continent .
give me the clipboard .
how very .
you 're welcome . it 's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor 's swing set .
then let 's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that 'll induce her to spew red , white , and blue .
sure . can we make an ice run before the funeral ?
our relationship 's moving fast , i know , but i have real , real respect for you .
like father , like son . a serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that 'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs . okay , so let 's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground .

daddy says the bible 's a load of bunkum !
saint mario !
all right , then .
where 's allison ?
i saw her drowning inside the car , detective .
this isn 't happening .
the same thing that always happens ! you blew it ! and this time you broke your son 's heart instead of mine ! he was so proud , looking forward to going to a movie with his father ... and you let him down ! like you let everybody down , always ! what did you do , take a mudbath ?
john , i 'm sure she could support just about anything . i think i 'll see you to your room . a sort of bodyguard . make sure no harm comes to you .
it 's been sometime since , uh , i received any , uh , of that kind of , uh ... attention . a couple of ... years .
and sold it to mister laplante , the fence , who 's now trying to blackmail poor john .
an hour after ... ! deak , for heaven 's sake ! let 's give her a night in new york city . we 'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel ...
look at the guy ! he just saved fifty people . now he 's going to disappear . who is he ?
i know someone else who 's sensitive .
did she water this plant ? it looks a little bent out of shape .
i 'd like you to see this .
i see your point , bedsoe , but i have to look at this from the law 's point of view . there 's something missing here . it 's something i 'm sure you 've come across many times in your career . it 's called evidence . get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it . find me an eye witness . dig up a motive . until then we don 't have a case against him .
i know that for six months you 've worked hard and asked for little . that you 're a good and honest man . what more need i know ?
it 's not been long enough . what witchcraft is this ?
if you search your heart you know all the good you have done . your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just . this room is filled with memories . if you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made . and now , it is for you to make the greatest difference of all . look in your heart , conner -- and you will see the good that you have done .
it 's happening right now .
mars ? ! whattaya think , dude ? out here on the edge , no one around , it 's perfect , right ?
jesus , first mars , now you . you two need anti-depressants .
you said they would be here , goddamnit ! where are they ?
you said they would be here !
junior kim was doa at the hospital .
yes , sir .
they nailed the windows . i can 't get 'm open .
yes , sir .
politics is power , paul . and money .
at least .
i need a great favor .
we can 't wait . we all go together or not at all .
please go back , bring the children to us .
there is one thing i need right away .
thank you , roger .
if that 's the fact , price , okay , you 've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
-- the `` saturation chamber . '' where he wanted to put me .
i think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation !
i 'm just the greeter -- and in that capacity , i now urge you all strongly to --
hell no ! ! the house will kill ya !
no ... not air --
oh . you think this is a request . well , think again . i 'm telling you : `` haunted hill '' is exactly where we 're having my party this year . you 'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
a simple leak , if it 's okay with you .
sorry , pritchett , here you go .
i can 't comment until i get paid .
i said we shouldn 't come down here . very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels , both . there 've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it 's exactly as it was in 1931 .
it 's dark ! i can 't breathe !
well that 's what we 're here for . i mean -
if we have a troubled spirit here , we have to find out why it 's troubled .
before .
yes , they are .
we 'll be there .
oh .
where ?
who 's that ?
fuck you !
rutherford auction ... that name ...
`` and though he 's slippery , he still gets caught . ''
damn travel agency . that kremlin thing is in moscow , isn 't it ?
close call , but she 's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious vatican organization . hawk , it 's time to go to the principal 's office ... .
actually we 're in italy , snickers , she said as if it made a difference .
snickers , baby , i love you like a brother , but really , who cares ? silencer bomb ...
never , why do you ask ?
like a `` cat '' , one could say .
hey , guys , i 've always wanted to sing like franki valli and the other seasons , but come on ... .
what job ?
that 's the beauty . it 's bullshit , but i can make it stick because i 'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who 's about to find out that there 's a thin line between ex-con and escape con .
weren 't you the bartender at jonestown ?
too bad .
yeah .
of course -- i went to the muncie , uh , secretarial polytechnic !
that 's it . a great wheel that gives us each what we deserve ...
oh norville , i --
says who ? !
lobby . we haven 't got all day .
okay , sid . like i said , you 're the expert , but --
nonsense , child ! i know wesley 's been drinking too much lately . i know a great deal more about what goes on at fort holland than you 'd think . i know all about you -- that you 're a nice girl , competent and kind to jessica . the fort needs a girl like you . but now we 've got to get you back there . i 'll walk you back and stay over night . it 'll be a nice change for me .
so -- he says i 'm nice . he 's a nice boy , too , miss connell , a very nice boy . but i 'm worried about his drinking .
that 's sweet of you , mrs. rand .
it 's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible , mr. holland . the insulin produces a state of coma , a stupor . the patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock . that nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind .
of course . it 's been nice of you to spend this much time with me .
i guess i 'll wait until i 'm home , mrs. rand .
it 's more than that , doctor . i 've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods ...
paul , we 're not trying to blame miss connell . it isn 't a question of blame . it 's a question of what we are to do with jessica . the commissioner is very concerned .
foolish ? tell them how foolish it is , paul -- tell them !
ben , i 'm going to florida . i hate thanksgiving and i hate the cold . i have a new nurse . she 's a negro , she weighs three hundred pounds , and i 've decided to leave my entire estate to her .
let 's see !
don 't worry about them . they 're at that party , getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff .
okay .
even the best make mistakes .
don 't do this , hap ...
habit .
you fell too much . so much you make me feel ...
and it means something else too , doesn 't it ? i shall never , ever grow up .
he 'll never let us go .
and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing , and it goes back , nothing proceeding from nothing , until there is nothing ! and we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge .
dying ?
do you think so ?
she would sleep in my coffin , daily , curl her child 's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of i know not what ...
claudia ! ! !
if i could see what you 've seen , feel what you 've felt i wouldn 't let it end like this ! you need a like to the world out there , a connection ... then it won 't end like this ...
idiot . idiot . idiot .
they never found the body .
then , we fight --
what ? the bahamas ? you 're kidding .
this weekend ?
it beets being on the mainland .
i 'll talk real slow .
i 'd hate for you to have to blow ... your whistle .
make it three hundred . and throw that in , too .
i 'm not waiting ... so give me the gun and keep the ring .
you collect these to sell , abroad ?
or even spirit messages from the next world .
in case you do so , would you --
they used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages . some still do --
that was my companion . she sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice , of course .
of course . tomorrow , perhaps , before i go ?
and the soldier -- he looked at me so strangely -- who is he ?
miss wollsten - my secretary , she 'd know .
we have no time for that .
it is for that he hates me .
for a moment , when he looked at me so sadly , i felt that i had wronged him . but then --
no -- you musn 't . he thinks i 've bewitched you . he won 't believe it - he 'll hate me even more ! my only chance is to stay away from him .
bert ! thank heaven you 're here !
what do you mean , i wasn 't there ? i remember distinctly . . .
yes , but george . . .
oh , look at this . champagne !
i 'm all right .
ummmm . . .
no . no .
look , nick . what 's wrong ?
have a good time , son .
aw , come on . be a sport . just dance with her one time and you 'll give her the thrill of her life .
yeah . . . . . . you can take this one off now .
okay , mom . you coming later ? you coming later , george ?
there 's a shark ... .
right .
never mind that shit . just point .
got it .
okay , okay .
temporarily ? uh ... sure ... .
my ass !
after we 've looked , we 'll talk .
just one minute ... .
go ahead , whatever it 's worth .
i 'm going .
i 'm not in the way . andy , am i in the way ?
len , can i see you a minute ?
he thought he had a good reason .
get your reserve bottle and let 's go .
i don 't understand .
precisely .
always do .
don 't hurry back .
he told me you both did ... .
we forgot to stop at the store .
spent it all on beer ... .
you 're silly ... .
it 's not nice to be evasive .
mother ... .
your brother 's dead ... your father 's dead ... .
it 's jake 's actually ... our floating lab ... .
come on , i 'll show you around .
you got a better idea ... ?
she 'll be all right , partner.. she 'll never find it . we couldn 't ... .
what 's that ... . ?
as the sun slowly sets in the west , we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch ... .
nothing.. but stay within a quarter mile ... i 've got a three-mile radius on the monitor . if he comes back i 'll hear him . you 'll have time to get up .
don 't flatter yourself ... .
good night , polly ... .
you heard . look for the knife .
`` welcome to eureka . ''
uh huh .. he 's well rehearsed ..
since when did you drink diet soda ?
i don 't see that at all ..
i don 't know . i guess she must have called him john ? i 'm mak- ing tea . would you like some ?
it was probably the wind .
sure you can . anyway , parties are all about standing still ..
a derelict .
jerry , this is what intimacy is !
no .
then you shouldn 't have begged me to hire him .
sure . yes . medical , i don 't know .
we decided to stay with you .
it 's either going to be denver or san diego trading up to take him .
okay .
he 's smart , dr. grant . and he knows so much about dinosaurs .
it is truly , whats the word ? inspiring .
from what i understand , it 's pretty much whatever we want .
i want to find them too , but we can 't do a bit of good right now . for every scary thing we saw in the daylight , i 'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night . am i right ?
how low ?
they set a trap they actually set a trap .
you 'd be surprised what people can do when they have too .
this plane can not land !
i want to see the nesting ground !
not without a shot of the nest .
you heard his , dieter . find a new spot . and remember , we 're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks .
good .
don 't start a legal argument with me , this island isn 't your property , and neither are these animals !
current evidence seems to be to the contrary , wouldn 't you say ? ! give it to them !
ian , nothing we observe will be valid if we 're trailing along in the wake of an army .
move where ? our boat 's not coming for two days , your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
damn !
rotten luck , this storm . get my grandchildren on the radio will you ? i don 't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain .
shhhhh !
the question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem , and therefore , how could you assume you can control it ? you have plants right here in this building , for example , that are poisonous . you picked them because they look pretty , but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're living in and will defend themselves . violently , if necessary .
six weeks ?
it 's my favorite .
i know .
yes , unless they figured out how to open doors .
you can 't just stroll down the road , you know .
that 'll - it 'd be a first ; man and dinosaur all die together . john 's plan .
nope .
let 's get you out .
i guess we 'll just have to evolve too .
yes .
chaotician , actually ! chaotician !
you 're all right , john you 're okay . it 's just you don 't have intelligence . you have `` thinktelligence . '' you think narrowly and call it `` being focused . '' you don 't see the consequences . you 're very good at solving problems , at getting answers - - but you just don 't know the right questions .
sure .
excellent .
he doesn 't look like he 's going anywhere , bill . and if necessary , i can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private .
video store ?
he 's my client , and this is important . enjoy your waitresses .
perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced .
-- in what sense ?
not a chance . i 'm the thinnest person i know .
close only by virtue of antithesis .
it 's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we 're up at the castle we suggest you don 't make a fuss . it would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects .
on the contrary , it matters a great deal . we 're engaged in immensely important research here . i 'm a revolutionary too , you know -- but a much more pragmatic one .
kong is a myth , nothing but a native superstition , miss darrow . all we 're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts . now , if you 'll excuse me , i 'm trying to reduce my handicap .
take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig !
father ... father !
all in due course , ann . our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to london .
value ? ... value ?
well , that was a monumental waste of time ! i pay good money , only to be taken on some wild goose chase ! i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator !
we should never have come ! i pay you good money , only to have my life endangered . you 'll be hearing from my lawyer !
i can 't get back to the wall ! i 'll get eaten !
how about ann ? is she going with you ?
is that what you gave him ?
trask wants to talk with you .
no . i 'm sore .
i believed her : the dumper was not tom grunemann .
i left them here . i was doing some work here .
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr. kramer 's care of his child ?
while the child was in the care of the witness , he cut his face badly and is now scarred .
yes ... how 's billy ?
you can 't tell it from a distance , ted .
beautiful .
you want to know the real kicker ? the real kicker is , for the first time in my life -- the first time -- i feel like a loser .
sure .
mmmmnph ... i 'll get you a cab ...
what ? ! ?
when joanna -- my ex-wife -- when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage ... well , i guess most of what she said was probably true . there were a lot of things i didn 't understand -- a lot of things i would do different if i could . just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could change ... but we can 't . some things , once they are done , can 't be undone . joanna says she loves billy . i believe she does . so do i . but the way it was explained to me , that 's not the issue . the only thing that 's supposed to matter here is what 's best for billy ... when joanna said why shouldn 't a woman have the same ambitions as a man , i suppose she 's right . but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex ? i guess i 've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent :
oh , christ.. .john , there 's some- thing i ought to tell you . my ... ah , situation has ... changed . i lost my job .
cow .
a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese .
arrange for me to speak to the people 's leaders .
crocodiles don 't sever with their teeth , their molars are blunt .
no thank you , but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log .
good thinking .
i guess .
pleading with a crazy man , with come all over my face .
lecter has already named buffalo bill .
yes sir . i can find it by myself .
i won 't disturb anything , mr. yow , i promise . be gone before you know it .
just briefly . what 's the problem , officer ?
you 're qualified and available . and frankly , i can 't spare a real agent right now .
they weren 't there . get close-ups .
no . i only hoped that your knowledge -
dr. danielson , the man we want was never your patient . it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence . please , doctor - time is eating us up . just show me the ones you 've turned away .
you want to see a violation ? this is a violation ...
duncan , you are absolutely gallant . if cora doesn 't marry you , i shall .
you know he wouldn 't send me ... ! you misrepresented what you saw and caused this . i , too , was at that farm . it was as he said ...
no . huron serve no one . the french father believes he fooled magua because he is so proud of his cleverness , he is blind . but it is the huron path that magua walks down , not the french one ... now , les francais , also , fear huron . that is good . when the huron is strong from their fear , we will make the terms of trade with les francais . and we will trade as the white man trades . take land from the abnakes ; fur from the osage , sauk & fox . and make the huron great . over other tribes . no less than the whites , as strong as the whites .
he did .
what dead one on the ship ?
crunch ... implosion .
no .
maybe you 're more one of us than you think ... sir .
and hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon ? ... no , thank you . i 'll take my chance down here .
jameson ? who 're you trying to con ?
honey , the company don 't give a flying fuck about `` whys , '' they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month .
sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in harry 's stone cold heart .
jesus , tom , do they work ?
i still will , if you don 't mind .
i 'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there .
er , yeah , sure , i 'll have 'em .
get the sodding gate open now , plank .
where did they get those outfits from ? haven 't we got some like that , tom ?
we paid seven hundred quid for those guns . they could hardly trace them to you , could they ?
the problem is , willy , that charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times , so just do as i say and keep the fucking cage locked .
i 'm sorry , sergeant major . there wasn 't anything i could do . shadow gets crazy --
dad , can i talk to you about track ?
cool .
appreciate it , sir .
better late than never . korean war hero , sheriff for near thirty years -- buddy deeds memorial p --
word gets out who that body was , people are gon na think buddy done it .
you believe that ?
they 'll never find out .
ok , see you downstairs .
because that would be too easy .
no , we 'll find something around here .
she 's a talk show host . they can 't be charmed . by definition .
it 's susan 's cooking , claire . that 's why uncle james lets them stay .
i found the pentacle .
if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again ...
townsend , he had some of father 's books .
i don 't know . probably have a copy of my birth certificate ... my apartment .
but you use potato ?
really ? well , come on , then .
i'ma be in the nba . you 're gon na be my cheerleader .
what ?
it 's ok , boy .
yeah , i 'm here , i 'm off the elevator , walking down the hall , now --
-- samuel johnson .
i don 't have to do a god damn thing .
marcie - calm down . calm down and don 't do this . i want you to stay --
when they want us done , they 'll call in the harvard s.w.a.t team or some shit .
i 'm sick of being the one , the one who always has to do everything , i don 't want to be the one always --
yes . dead . two nights ago . the night of my dream .
soon enough . here we are .
bread and wine ... in that cupboard .
michelle , she -- the king has invited her to come live in the palace .
i can not , athos . dearly as i love you , i can not .
you will protect me as you always have , d'artagnan .
oh louis , louis ...
oh for chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of --
hey what they did on their time was their business , you know ? i just want to catch this scumbag , wherever he is .
it wasn 't in the cards .
what else is new ?
when do they go to press ?
why don 't you get birmingham p.d . a methane probe out of d.c. and have them cover the backyard ... maybe the cat 's dead and the kids buried it .
some remarkable events have happened in birmingham and atlanta . do you know what i 'm talking about ?
shut up . stop . stop it .
no .
of course ! that 's what negotiations are for .
oh no ! did he get hurt ?
there 'll be other shots .
no , i 'm not gon na take it . if i take it i 'll break my back .
andy , they don 't think you suck . they 've just ... lost a reason to love you .
y-yeah ? well , then it has to stop ! because if these bad vibes get out ... then everyone will be talkin ' about how sick i am , and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy , and then -- i 'm dead .
but it 's funny ! it 's a practical joke . they 'll get frustrated !
but it 's only for thirty seconds !
gosh . gee , lynne ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves . ext . movie theater - day
no ! you get in the kitchen . i 'm gon na make you dry my dishes !
oh .
all the time . it 's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly .
you killed them .
what -- what lesson ?
how did you know ... ?
hey ! you want good stuff , or you want shit ?
be careful .
'take a little tip from mack the knife ... '
thanks for the ride .
oh , that 's too bad , teresa ...
me ? i wouldn 't say a word to my aunt and uncle ... or even your uncle , charlie ...
he has about twenty-eight bucks ... it 's all he has on him .
ok , how 's everything going ?
whatever .
our friend , groppi , went to his mother 's house . and when he was there ... at night ...
now don 't get excited . don 't get excited ! !
what ? !
as much as joe 's ?
go right ahead . tell william parrish how you betrayed him at a secret board meeting . and tell allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company .
where are you going ?
i don 't understand .
well said , eddie . mr. black , shall we ?
cut it out , susan . you and i 've got to talk . big day tomorrow , everybody . joe , let 's go .
memento pink revisions - 9/7/99
hi , leonard .
hi , leonard .
i have this condition -
no . no , just let me think for a minute .
fucking hope not .
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership ?
sammy didn 't have a wife .
why would i have a gun ?
there 's three between miami international and the glades . i 'm gon na try for her , but this is triage . protect the maximum number of lives . you need to know that ...
and what is that ?
reality tv and stay by the phone . that 's what all wives-in-crime do ...
nothing . 'cause how you do delivery on the beach , i don 't like . maybe this does not work .
wait by the phone . you get a call . or maybe you don 't . until then , piss off back to where you come from ...
you don 't like us finding your load ? we can go and lose it all over again ...
funny thing , you mentioning money . i was just about to ask your for some ...
oh , it ain 't cheap . i mean , yeah , i 'd say this was an all right shirt . don 't like to , uh , you know , have a lot of cheap stuff on my back .
well , joe , you 're a nice guy , and i 'd be doing you both a favor , but why ? what 'm i dragging my bum leg all over town for ? it 's no picnic and what for , for me myself , what ?
well , uh , my manager 's gon na manage all that crap , or else he gon na get a coconut up his flue .
and end up a hunchback like my old man ? you think i 'm crippled ? you shoulda caught him the end of a day .
he can 't read . even dumber than you . couldn 't write his own name . x -- that 's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone . one big lousy x like our flat . condemned . by order of city hall .
walk ? naturally i can walk .
stop shitting me , man !
you wan na keep up the conversation , you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude .
all right , motherfucker , that 's it .
depends . you got a memo ?
peter , you couldn 't even fix our tv !
we 're down to a `` couple '' now , huh ?
don 't get kinky here ...
i 'll be late .
we ?
that 's camouflage ...
how ? !
try not to sweat ?
that 's it . that 's it . breathe easy .
but you didn 't even taste your cocoa .
following me ?
yeah , yeah ...
well , this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff .
just from his agent .
if it 'll make you feel any better i won 't do it again .
i 'll be damned . it 's mccloy , the biocyte ceo .
so do i . sort of .
ethan , tell me -
you were there .
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers ?
the question is why ? what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying ?
what about him ... ?
don 't move .
i wouldn 't dream of it .
they stamped it , didnt they ? those damn gideons .
hurry up .
none of your business .
my liege , i am honored .
no ! not the knights who say `` ni '' !
i am an enchanter .
why do you think she is a witch ?
no , no , we must find the grail .
yes ! with a herring ! with a herring ! cut down with a herring !
i 'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan i 'd be wearing anyway . that 's as much as a page of the back stairs gets and that job 's only for toffs . i 'm her majesty 's highland servant ! indoors and out . there 's no stopping me now .
get out . out !
she needs me , archie . she canna do without me , she said it to my face . how can i stop now ?
i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me . doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box !
that 's a tautology lad . if you say the queen arranges something , you 've no need to say she 's done it personally . that 's understood .
well , you tell her majesty from me , if her husband was here now , he 'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her . what the hell 's the point in me being here otherwise ? !
sir henry is not alone . they all wish it . the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank --
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit , a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming . literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson .
forgive me , ma'am , i can not speak for the nation , only for myself . as prime minister i confess i miss your presence , but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and i should not burden you with it .
the same , your majesty .
sure . every game 's got 'em . i 'll start with the schematics . i can print these up if you want .
sure .
got it .
never been on a snowboard .
yes ... but ... how did you ...
the air-force is working on the same thing .
where 's the dock ?
good . nice to see you , bruce . johnny .
you have issues . i mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out .
let 's go .
because of my charming personality ?
you were one of those guys that played dungeons & dragons with real swords , weren 't you .
that 's cute asshole .
you 've got to be kidding me ! his lazy ass couldn 't win the special olympics .
son , let 's watch the tape .
i 'm just looking for our best interests . may i have the tapes , bruce ?
yahoo ! ! ! ! !
which one , this door is locked !
i 'm fine .
we made it !
i don 't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing .
yes i know , it runs in the family . new book ?
you better ace it ... you sacrificed our whole vacation .
i 'll do better than that . i 'll send you off with your own private guide .
oh i see , 'cause usually that doesn 't require such a lengthy consultation .
oh no .
okay .
okay , sure .
goodnight .
really ?
sorry .
i told him not to tease those bees . did he get stung ?
something like that .
the wandering sportswriter .
solid and genuine is not boring . michael can be completely insane ...
then why are you compulsively eating ? if you 're not hysterical ?
i know that ! i was distracted by grief !
what do you suggest ?
hey , handsome . brevity this ...
you need a few dollars .
he said that , too .
so your honeymoon is exactly where ?
... garden sports , all . little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit , represents a packing challenge , but there 's fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit ...
you don 't understand . i 've never felt this way about anybody !
actually , it all starts tomorrow . it 's one of those four-day weddings , with all the traditional events , and ten million people flying in from madagascar such .
... thomas , yeh .
i got the point .
boy , those were the days .
you need a baby-sitter . that 's what i 'm here for .

tomorrow is sunday . nobody 's doing business . crack of dawn , monday , walter 'll take you up there ...
you 're right . easy come , easy go .

i just want to be alone . is that okay ?
... me , yeah . and she likes tommy lasorda . case closed .

michael ! !
i see .
oh , sure .
bill , he 's a crazy man .
money 's no object .
yes , you are .
we are . your camera .
capt'n !
fine . roger , what the hell are you doing ? you 're bothering the serial killer .
thanks .
you got a problem all right .
she was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware .
he 's a vat grown ninja , the royal family 's bodyguard . watch out for him , he 's no joke .
we won 't have to . the run is tomorrow night .
it 's so easy for you , isn 't it ? you let linda lee die in chiba city . now you leave me with molly , one more lamb to the slaughter . perhaps it 's _your_ soul that should be in question , mr. case .
how long , dixie ?
i 'll give it my best shot , mother fucker .
no . it 's important to be able to feel those things . we 're going to pull this run off , molly , and we 've got to do it soon .
yeah . let 's do that .
professor of medieval literature . novelist . weekend flautist .
well i 'm so glad that you guys are .
oh ! how about `` under the sea ? ''
i 've kissed guys . i 've just never kissed a guy . felt that thing --
sometimes opposites attract .
it is hoped that it 's not a mess . `` hopefully '' is an adverb . it means `` with hope '' . you have it defining the copy , and i 'm pretty sure the copy doesn 't have feelings .
you 're a sick puppy , geller .
i know .
really ?
no !
yeah , why ?
wow ...
ghostbusters are fearless .
what are you gon na do ? how are you gon na help ? i 'm losing my mind . i don 't want to have you watch me fall apart .
i can 't !
i 'm so proud of you all . tell neil i ...
you know what he did . he 's doing it again .
no ...
accident my ass . i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here .
eighteen yards . that 's my house there .
well , i 've been on a diet since i was nineteen , which means basically i 've been hungry for a decade . i 've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me : and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment . meantime , it cost millions to get me looking like this ...
i don 't want a goddamn cup of tea . i want to go home .
and what would you say ...
i 'm sorry . is this a problem ?
okay -- take a seat . i 'll check .
is it someone we know ?
yes , she is fairly fabulous .
well , there are . and we don 't need to go anywhere near that far . my best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs , cracked her back and she 's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life . all i 'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective .
oh sure . of course .
i mean , the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having . i know that to be the case , but the way in which you broached it , if that 's your idea of teaching me something ...
mister mcmurphy !
thank you , ma'am ...
mister mcmurphy , there are old men here who couldn 't hear the music at all if it were lower . that music is all they have , and i wish you wouldn 't lean against the glass there , your hands are staining the window .
she ain 't peckin ' at your eyes , buddy .
now , what would i be trying to say ?
hold it a minute .
i don 't believe it ...
gim me those dice . i 'll blow this board to pieces . here we go ... lebenty leben , count me over eleven , martini ...
how 's your ass been holdin ' up , honey ?
why , my head would just squash like an eggplant , mcmurphy .
he likes to read ... did he mention anyone in particular ?
the sun also rises . for whom the bell tolls . the old man and the --
actually , i think i prefer katherine hepburn .
yeah . he 's around somewhere .
look , i know you think this is irresponsible of me , but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person .
faith , i 've seen it already , okay ? if i spot somebody who 's got a head that 's an eighth of an inch around , standing underneath a tuba , i 'll recognize him from the photo . otherwise , i 'm telling you , it 's not gon na do me any good .
you 've travelled over six thousand miles and now you 're gon na play hard to get ?
i told you . if he sees me here with another guy , he 's gon na think i 'm here with another guy . i just don 't want to send any confusing signals .
so you 're just quitting ? just like that ?
ten billion to one .
be sure they got enough water .
i 'm so frightened .
why don 't we talk about it later ?
i brought 'em , they 're back at glades in the cadillac . you wanted to take her car .
he ain 't the problem , jack .
you 're right .
am i going to detroit by myself ?
i don 't know .
whatta you wan na do ?
you told me i can come 'cause i caught you digging the fuckin ' tunnel , saw you and lulu coming out of the bushes , thought maybe you two were making out .
i don 't smoke .
i 'm a federal marshal and you 're under arrest , both of you guys .
oh , uh , right , thanks ...
oh , yeah , i 'm calm . in fact , i 'm totally `` relaxed ... ''
i 'm not angry , richard . in fact , i 'm completely relaxed . thing is , i can 't tell if it 's the fish that 're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there .
five point two .
if they 're not busted now , they 're gon na be . it 's wide open .
the combination is three-ten-forty-four .
no . course not .
i knew it , soon as i saw they were offering a reward .
so the woman 's married . she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it . but you don 't reveal her name , you protect her . it sounds like you 're saying it 's okay as long as her husband doesn 't find out about it . like the guy who cheats on his wife , saying what she doesn 't know won 't hurt her .
i take it back , about the flowers . we 're all gon na die .
i 've already got some in . i was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight . how would you like that ?
aren 't we a little old for that ?
what if we 're witnessing the end of touch dancing ?
he won 't tell me , but i 've got my suspicions . and i don 't want any of that . don 't keep her out late .
she 's unbelievable . who needs satellites when we 've got dolores 's mouth ?
you need a partner . there 's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars , mr. fitzsimmons . i 've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night .
this is not giving blood . this is drunk .
please don 't shout .
oh . i forgot .
can i tell diane that peggy sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret ? well ?
you have an incredible memory .
what if it 's beyond science ? what it it 's god ?
oh , go feel up your hamsters ! i hear rodents put out .
there are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes .
i 'll be fine , dad .
is he gon na be okay ?
hey , i 'm so sorry i 'm not the stud that you are .
you never get over it .
so what ? it 's nothing to be ashamed of . you have nothing to be ashamed of , okay ?
i am relaxed .
yes . i think it will be a simple solution . they 'll put it in a syringe , inject it into your bloodstream . it 'll neutralize the virus . it 'll revitalize the immune system , and people with aids will become healthy again .
sounds delightful .
you 're in trouble .
give me the camera , joe .
we ought to be suing him .
you have to make a decision : is this guy partner material ?
well , is someone coming for us ? or are we all just gon na die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse ? hey , you don 't have to worry about scaring me .
no , we 'd never ... .oh , god , honey , you shoulda told me sooner .
let 's drop back an ' boot up .
riddick ? how close ?
we 'll have to carry the cells ... drag them ... whatever it takes .
shut up .
that 's what i said .
we can stick to the plan . if we get four cells back to the skiff , we 're off this rock .
there is no `` safe . ''
all deserts have water , somewhere . god shall lead us there .
the child heard you before any of us could even ... .
didn 't say that . but least this way i don 't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin ' up .
well , just keep your bloody-fuckin ' eyes open . don 't want that ratbag sneakin ' up on me bloody-fuckin ' arse .
certainly , sir . i 'll get my notes and come right over .
good luck then .
and they fell out of the sky with you ?
right . let 's put the water and provisions in the wagon .
well , dr. zira ? this is a man , is he not ?
proceed . but don 't turn this hearing into a farce .
very well . i suggest we go and look at them .
be it so ordered . the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question . this hearing is adjourned .
i 'll start by following the shoreline . and my nose .
bailiff ! stop this outburst ! gag that monstrosity !
dr. zaius , i could have sworn he was answering you !
you 're going back to the forbidden zone ?
god bless you .
i thought it was o'neill 's turn tonight .
yeah , they had claymores strung up in the trees , blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces . baad shit .
shaddup bitch .
he dugged his own grave .
how do you do ?
sure ... but somebody always does..
where would she go , anyway . don 't tell me you haven 't got her covered .
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again .
i never wear a hat . oh , so i am . i forgot . i guess i 'm terribly sorry again , mrs. west .
i 'll take your word .
how do you do , sir .
well , we were just ...
take your hand off my shoulder right now .
yeah , sure . why not ? you two screw-ups deserve each other . that 's why i put you together in the first place . christ pappas , you 're as bad as he is ... talk about the blind leading the blind --
the ex-presidents are the best i 've seen , kid .
sure .
fuck you , johnny utah . fuck you ! ! don 't you have a soul ? goddamn you to hell !
we take her and she 'll give away our position , every chance she gets . no prisoners , dillon .
now what , dutch . you going to send your mystery guest an invitation ?
i 'll take him .
the best friend i ever had .
when i was a little girl , my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad , which was pretty often . i 'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen . then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up . rescue me from the tower , and then we 'd ride off ... but never , ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say , `` come on baby , i 'll put you up in a great condo . ''
what ?
aw , come on , bill . it 's just business .
as you wish .
okay . all right , now , let 's see . where were we ? oh yes . in the pit of despair .
i swear it will be done .
of course .
oh , i know . the people are quite taken with her . it 's odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day , i thought that was clever . but it 's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night . once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged . they 'll demand we go to war .
let me explain -- -- no , there is too much . let me sum up . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 99 .
stop saying that !
sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world . except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe . they 're so perky , i love that . but that 's not what he said . he distinctly said `` to blave . '' and , as we all know , `` to blave '' means `` to bluff . '' so you 're probably playing cards , and he cheated
whoever he is , he 's too late -- -- see ? the cliffs of insanity . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 19 .
i 'm leo bloom , i 'm an accountant , i 'm from whitehall and marks , i was sent here to do your books and i 'm terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady .
koff , koff ... ahem , ahem ... harrumph ...
go away from me . you frighten me . sit over there .
ahhhhhh . leo , leo , leo .
you mean out of business . heh , heh .
your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars .
i don 't need pills ... just sleep .
all right ! then call ! at least , call !
he 's already been .
explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what 'd he exactly say when he called you ?
he wasn 't out when you were there . he just wasn 't answering the door in the dead of night ... like some people do . this fellow lives like a hermit ...
hm -- pressure -- to buckley . that 's all right . we 'll talk later .
you found buckley ?
how ? what can i do ?
delighted , i 'm sure .
it is no trouble at all , my child . this is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create . my footing is not too secure .
yes , you could . cut out this rotten business and act like a lady . marry me .
horsefeathers !
i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place .
you have done well , and now i , too , have something for you . come .
you taking any medication ?
wait . i want to tell you something .
quiet , you little muddy-eyed brat , or ill kill you !
you shouldn 't watch such things , doll .
sense doesn 't mean anything to rose . but i think we 're on safe ground now . daddy chained up the ladder , whoever it is can 't get in the house .
well , well , well . so miss rosebud has arrived . un-hmm . and you 're all assembled here . yes , indeed . un hmmm .
rose , my patience is wearing thin . first a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away . this is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show .
rose , i realize you don 't know this boy , but if you know anybody who does know him , if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be , then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife ... and i don 't mean maybe .
well , it has buttons .
what ?
daddy wouldn 't hear that . now the redhaired boy you see sitting there , of course you have met him , he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child . all children have great creative powers , but i don 't want to rattle on about my children , they say i brag too much about them , especially about brother . am i boring you , rose ?
mrs. hillyer , this girl is sick in more ways than one . she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses . it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others . therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary . it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me .
oh , no , that 's the style . it 's meant to be clinging .
what ? wha-at ? mrs. hillyer ?
i 'm not hungry . i can 't eat nothin ' , i haven 't been able to eat since i got fired . i think maybe i 'm sick .
... okay ... you made your point .
really ? is that a fact ... ?
word is , while the vice cops on the east coast were standing around playing pocket pool , 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into new york city . and , right now it 's making a cross-country journey to hollywood , u.s.a .
you big , fat sonofabitch , if it weren 't for me , you 'd still be sitting in the file room where i found you . and you ... nena ... you 've still got needle scars from where i pulled you out of . you of all people ...
could be worse . i don 't know how , but i 'm sure it could .
well , i got something.. pop-sweet 's accounting ledger for the disco-strip . all the money transactions . look ... someone 's putting their initials beside the weekly totals . like they 're acknowledging a deposit .
you 're lying ...
wave that flag , hero . keep dreaming those dreams .
let 's hope .
is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice ?
gimmie a minute .
there 's not even enough places to stash it in a car .
she hasn 't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have , luke ... but the force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . there is no avoiding the battle . you must face and destroy vader !
his lightsaber .
all set .
that 's all any of us can see .
hey , don 't worry . chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
on second thought , let 's pass on that , huh ?
you may dispense with the pleasantries , commander . i 'm here to put you back on schedule .
you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .
i told you , my car broke down .
just a moment , janet . they may have a telephone .
i didn 't make him for you
oh .
... goodnight , rocky .
yeah ...
people nothin ' , you in a fight , my man , -- ya best believe what you hear ... knock that boy out soon an ' let 's go home .
sure , rocky , bob 's good for it ...
... fine .
c'mon , valiant , doesn 't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? i mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place ?
thanks for the vote of confidence .
he 's a toon ... who cares ?
ask her ...
he had a will , all right . she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off . then she set up her loving husband to take the fall .
yes , and for that you 're charged with aiding and abetting . but we 'll let santino handle that .
look , doll , if i wanted underwear , i woulda broken into frederick 's of hollywood . i was lookin ' for marvin acme 's will .
that 's because i don 't have a doorbell .
that 's what you woke me up for ?
sure , valiant , sure ...
men 's eyes were made to look , and let them gaze . i will not budge for no man 's pleasure , i .
i fear , too early : for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night 's revels and expire the term of a despised life closed within my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death . but he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail ! on , lusty gentlemen .
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter now . we must entreat the time alone .
and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor . ah me , how sweet is love itself possessed when but love 's shadow 's are so rich in joy . news from verona . how now , balthasar ? ! dost thou not bring me letters from the priest ? how doth my lady ? is my father well ? how doth my lady juliet ? for nothing can be ill if she be well .
as if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her , as that name 's cursed hand did murder her kinsman .
of course .
very good . now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid .
i don 't want you dead , woman , i want the the truth !
and then ...
exactly . gregor , he was the russian 's man . it was my people came up with the idea for this run , but the russians who had the capital to finance it . gregor , he was their insurance , and i was ours . everybody else was supposed to be neutral . gregor must 've got to swede ...
come off it , sam -- if we weren 't friends already we wouldn 't be here now , would we ?
fine with fucking me , we got work to do . i don 't care what it takes , we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gon na pay us a great deal of money when we do . i don 't know about the rest of you guys , but i 'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass . i don 't mean that in , like , a literal way ...
did he bring that with him ?
i don 't think so .
but you can 't .
seamus reilly .
none of them had any --
maybe . who cares ?
i don 't know .
he saw everything !
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
what are you thinking ?
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
no . it 's not .
he 's irresponsible .
we appreciate that .
so there was money there ! who the hell 's money is it ? !
well i 'm here now .
then what the hell are you all about ?
stop ! stop ! i don 't need the money . you can have it all .
all right , kenny . thanks . you 're off the hook . for now .
i don 't think so ...
c'mon , lee . he 's going to jail . you won , now just put the gun down .
carter ... you ready to have some fun ! ?
ask me if i give a shit .
it 's worth it to me .
it 's okay . i can finally let it go .
yes . he was part of the juntao crime family . he may be juntao himself . and he dropped this .
hey , don 't worry . nothing 's gon na happen to it .
good . that 's standard military packaging for plastique . get a look under it .
hey , i was senior . it 's ok . this is why i get the big bucks .
try a bus load of - no , make that two bus loads of chinese --
bob is making her visualize the ceremony .
no . no , you didn 't .
tootaloo .
are you a reporter ?
you 'll answer my questions ?
you have one ?
a pre-wedding luau ?
obviously , i 'm not the only one who doesn 't understand it . the uss maggie leaves quite a wake ... excuse me .
he 's an entomologist ! i thought it was very unique .
agreed .
you know , there 's no ...
i don 't have much choice in the matter now , do i ? but i can 't speak for italics . traitor !
it 's something i 've always wanted to do .
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things .
thanks . will you fix my hair ?
that 's good .
he 's allergic to everything , don 't worry about it --
good . perfect . i 'll be in new york with walter , i can squeeze it in .
how am i going to explain this to walter ?
come on , jonah --
i think it 's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better .
it 's hard to imagine .
what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio ?
i don 't think i have to now .
there 's nothing stopping you .
you can 't send him back to oklahoma . it 'd be inhumane .
he will if he wants us to go on blasting .
good . come in , we 'll work it out . sit down , sit down .
with ramn it 's ... pride . i spoke out of the bitterness in me . and he was hurt .
it isn 't right , she says . was it right that we bought this ... this instrument ?
i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor .
no , no ... we wouldn 't do it .
i don 't want you hanging around there , hear ?
i was talking to my wife .
i understand . thanks anyway .
you always been this stubborn ?
10 % . that 's ...
because i don 't want to see you end up like kujo and those other losers . i thought that maybe if you knew that i didn 't use , you might see it in yourself to go clear .
i 'm sorry . i couldn 't .
you 're a good man . jimmy the finn .
big bill
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time ?
didn 't you hear ? domingo 's dead .
now that 's scary !
yeah , i 'd hate to shoot you by accident .
shit , that was no big deal .
they got squirrels there , too , right ?
forward ! forward ! now reverse !
i thought you were my mother .

oh , captain , they 'll always make lingerie , it 's one of the three basic needs of man -- food , shelter , silk teddies . miller dream on , private .
on the bridge ! we 're coming in .
see to it .
... for you to blow up , yeah , yeah , we heard that .
what about you , captain ?
brains stay with brains . the bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques .
if you were diane court , would you honestly fall for lloyd ?
why ? it 's fine . it 's nice .
no , listen to me . you 're the best in the country , don 't you understand ? it 's like a pyramid . it starts out with everybody , and it narrows through your life and through everything , and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents . and it 's you . so tell me something , where 's the flaw in that ? there is no flaw .
oh . okay then ... lloyd dobler , 555-1342 .
you 're kidding .
i pay you too much .
you 're welcome , i 'm sure you 're doing a great job .

sssshhh . on screen the phone rings . the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook . she grabs it , running from the bathroom , into the living room , grabbing the phone .
well if you won 't work for me , will you work for the president ?
wrong , this issue is sidney prescott ! and either mr. riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her . so , where is she ?

henslowe , you pound of tripe , in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage , so don 't tell me about business
oh . what is your name ?
lady viola isyoung in the world . your majesty is wise in it . nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting . i 'll wager my fortune .
it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .
just stop worrying .
anyway , what i was wanting to say was this --
i mean , what are you actually doing here ? what is the hidden agenda ?
now , let me get this straight . this affair that you 're not having , is it not with a man or not with a woman ?
ok , so a has left you , b is ambivalent , you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you , i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love .
he seemed like a nice guy , alex .
he 's right . you 'd feel much better about it .
oh , shut up , alex .
ok , i 'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i 'd like you to name the song , the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band .
you did , didn 't you ?
sweetheart , you 're drunk .
no shit ?
okay .
fine .
of course not .
sure thing , mr. karpf . c'mon .
okay , mom .
will you indeed , mr. torrance .
it 's not a matter that concerns you , mr. torrance - at least not at this point .
oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first .
yeah ... that 's all it is .
oh !
oh well he sure did a beautiful job . pink and gold are my favorite colors .
i don 't know . maybe he doesn 't know , either .
if you don 't stop it i 'm going to vomit . i mean it .
yeah ! what is it ?
i told you !
and what do you suggest i do about it , dear boy ?
-and babcock , i remember . now go on !
we won 't !
joey -- do it .
that used to be true , vince . i was with you . but something happened . and i 'm different now . real -- different . i 've had , well , you might call it -- a religious experience . and i 've got just two words for you . and those two words are ...
right .
i hear you . how many days a week do you rehearse ?
you re okay -- for a civilian .
well , you know , you don 't have to tell her everything . i mean , nothing really happened . we just ... took a walk .
honor thy mother and thy father too don 't kill , don 't steal , it 's bad for you
a thank-you ? for what ? you 're the one we should be thanking .
right to hell . just kidding . where is that bus ?
maybe hawaii .
don 't call again . it 's not safe . i 'll be in touch .
yeah , right -- when i see it .
all right . it 's a beginning . las vegas , nevada .
she 's our inspiration !
does that look like an animal hanging ?
the militia ?
believe ?
how could something named `` the tree of the dead '' fail to draw attention ?
i need time for thinking . without you hanging on my coattails for a change .
nothing . to hell with this place and all the people here .
what troubles you ?
goddamnit , scooter , come on . pardon my language , ma'am .
what do you want , hun ?
what are you doin ' with that damn hammer ?
that ain 't none of your damn bidness . besides that 's the way friends do one another . fuck it , i 'm gon na go call 'em . honey , find my guitar , i think it 's out there in the garage with that loony tune .
come on , don 't be a pussy . everybody has to work .
shhhh ! this is the national anthem .
i 'm glad of it , honey .
i ain 't really thought about it too much i don 't reckon .
i told you , i ain 't got no boy , now get on out from here and let me be .
all right then .
can i help you , sir ?
wonderful . when your next book is published , maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i 'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up .
i wouldn 't think of it . see you around , fellas .
we 'd better be . i haven 't spent a night out of brooklyn in fourteen years , and i 'm not about to break my record now . besides , i 've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning .
you got it .
sure thing . see you later .
what difference does it make ?
pick two or three . now that the coffers are open , you might as well take advantage of me .
now ask him who his mother was .
what are you sellin ' 'em for ? why don 't we start there .
in the war . europe , i believe . they could hardly send him to the pacific , could they ?
just showed up at my door , big as life and twice as mean . wanted to talk to my son .
well , it does seem mighty warm in here . specially for mr. hooks .
it 'll be over soon . i can get you money .
i don 't mean everyone . just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them . or run a newspaper .
... but he found you .
these are fishermen , alvin . they don 't talk at all to each other and less to me . specially gossip .
he said , 'could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , 'you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? '
objection !
my expertise . is that i 'm a journalist .
like you couldn 't believe .
sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . right above your left ear .
i should show them an american ?
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that .
clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
i 'll think of something . don 't crowd me .
knock it off , will you ?
you wouldn 't hit a girl , would you ?
get it while you 're young . and you better fix your lips . you want to look nice for osgood , don 't you ?
yeah - lets shove off .
come on , daphne .
i know what you need - a slug of bourbon .
oh , no !
what a heel ! i spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled , i buy me a new negligee , i bake him a great big pizza pie ... - and where were you ?
lets throw another log on the fire .
sorry , sir . that 's reserved for members of the immediate family .
goodbye , charlie .
no , spats - no , no , no - no !
what ? why ? what do you mean ?
actually , i do .
it was just after we moved here . my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they havent made up since .
its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute , need a prostitute . you did the right thing .
im a hooker .
i dont do naked . my sister ? she does naked .
i think thats disgusting .
this is awkward for me . talking about it makes me feel better .
ahoy !
hard .
will do .
boy , you don 't make funny with your daddy like that .
come here , son ...
thank you , daddy ...
yes , daddy ! yes !
my father taught me ...
why don 't you try and git you a new dog ?
good ! but you don 't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it ! you 'll get that woman in trouble !
i got to , mama . i know daddy wants to see him .
thank you , miss boatwright .
and if they saw me pitch the way i did today -- they 'd hire me just to strike out babe ruth !
the season is a long way off , mr. howard , and by that time , nathan oughta be home . if he ain 't , believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops . we have to because we owe you all that money -- mr. howard .
ike , you could make a song outta that !
maybe that 's who your father is , cartman !
sheet !
it was the terrance and phllip movie !
no , what does that mean , find the clitoris ?
this will be very dangerous ... are you quite sure ?
dude , what the hell is going on ?
yeah ...
what 's the difference ?
we 're going to find our boys ! for god 's sake sheila , you almost had them killed ! !
a letter from who , you shit sucking cock master ?
i sure did , phillip ! !
i know , terrance . i know .
you remember ... saddam hussein , don 't you ? !
okay , kid , i have a deal for you ! if you want out of hell , all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores . ' they 're rich , chocolatey and really hit the spot . bring me ten proofs of purchases and we 'll grant you any wish you want .
relax bitch ! you 're better seen , not hear okay ?
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do .
very professional of you .
nah , i already ate . why don 't you just go down there ?
who said i 'll re-enter in the pod ? i got friends out in space , ryan , friends willing to get me back unnoticed . thank god for deregulation huh ?
the others decided to get cute with me , so i 'm teaching them a lesson !
i don 't have a problem with it . besides , you get to meet a lot of interesting people .
you 're right .
why ? where are you going ?
it would matter to us .
try not to think about it .
that is one of my priorities .
well what would you know about it ? you don 't have anything to lose .
what are you going to do about it ?
i 'm sorry . the suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated , zero gravity atmosphere . i 'm afraid that 's off limits to all passengers .
he 's my dad .
so buzz , let 's skedaddle . mr. kastle is waiting . as buzz gets up , theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs .
is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock ? junior looks from one man to the other , breathing heavily , his nostrils flaring .
sheila , meet ... uh ... i forget the name .
clam it !
that 's right , didn 't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament , champ ? now go take out your `` big four '' , darling . come on , we 're making her nervous .
i think buzz is retiring soon . in fact , i think he 's retiring tonight . kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila .
i 'm not here to - i can 't ...
plan c. from now on it 's gon na be plan c. both bodies throb and grind , their sandy hands sliding over each others ' sweaty skin .
what are you -- his mother ? get norman , i want everyone ready to go . edmunds , the subs ?
he understands me fine .
she 's not gon na know , sir .
what ? no , i know they 're civilians ...
what are they ?
you 're not afraid of the water , are you , norman ?
shutup , ted . you didn 't notice shit . keep hammering .
it 's been obvious from the start , hasn 't it , captain ? that 's why all the secrecy , why no one was told about it ?
look closely . that isn 't writing . those are grooves .
yeah , i 'll work on it , too .
when he uses a phrase like `` i am happy '' , i think we should think twice about what we ask him .
why 's that ?
i 'm not sure .
of course he did . he 's been isloated for 400 years . he wants someone to talk to . look , you put a human being in isolation for four days , they can become neurotic , sometimes psychotic . we 're talking about 400 years here . an alien that shows emotional responses . i think we need to address him , before he reacts further .
i 'm ben kenobi . luke starkiller here is leading our expedition .
i 'm afraid it 's been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars . but i have the memories .
five , maybe . let me handle it .
he 's bluffing ...
i don 't get it , but i guess i did block it .
did it occur to you they might find us ?
i 'd like to get paid before that eventually . i don 't plan to stick around for the fireworks .
we have a little business to take care of first , but it shouldn 't take long . we 'll be back shortly .
all right , all right ! you 've got a ship ! but where do we go from here ? they probably took her to find the hidden bases ... i don 't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks . the empire has already beat us out .
good ! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around .
move out of the way !
i know , but the chances for survival here just aren 't great enough in my book . i 've got what i came for . now i 've got to get back to my ship .
thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .
indeed , sir , sometimes i 'm amazed we 're in as good shape as we are , what with the rebellion and all ...
i know , sir , but it 's the principle of the thing .
yes , sir !
maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ...
zander , please ... let 's go !
i 'll go for that .
ibanez ... let 's go !
yes , ma'am . star drive in three ... two ... one ...
teenagers !
it 's aterm of service , not a career . i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years .
sorry . carl 's a fine boy ...
it 's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .
yes , sir ! fleet , this is roughneck patrol , over ... ?
keep trying , sergeant .
aaaaaaaaaaa !
uh , no .
hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
we 're not leaving you here , sir !
give'em hell , sir !
mr decker ... .
they could have many ways of destroying things , mr. decker .
captain ... i 'd like to go along ...
mr. scott , there 's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet ...
our ... 'insignificance ' ?
but they understood our messages ; they broke off the attack .
delay that order , scotty ... ! disengage all main drive systems !
high mag , mr. sulu !
there is no alternative .
and i need a drink .
you were in the car with bob ?
the breasts symbolize motherhood ...
is he cool or angry ?
i have to work on my video project ! don 't follow me ! i can put myself to bed .
i 'll ride ahead . nelson , protect the queen ...
sex . of course .
until he 's old enough to read .
no ! you 're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing i can 't sleep otherwise .
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel 's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches ?
is that like luigi 's ?
where are you , anyway ?
is your bad ?
rache can do that part .
have you still never told him ?
sooner than later . you really need to .
duncan . my work is everything to me . this 'll never happen again . now stand back -- this session 's gon na make you remember why you hired me even though i wouldn 't sleep with you -- cooper let 's get these penguins dancing --
we don 't know if you 've got it , we haven 't seen it yet ! now go back and finish !
just not to me .
no . you think this is going to help the kids then you do it . you 're on your own .
a lot smaller .
what ? and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders ? how many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors ?
... it 's my problem , too .
no .
so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck .
just sit me up . nice and tall . bring benjamin first .
no , she threw you out . what a difficult woman .
yeah , well , mikey , listen up . cause here 's a lesson : life 's not fair .
well , now you have .
don 't be . your movie 's a hit .
used to filmore , used to .
rule two : without alternative , use yourself as a shield .
it seems to me we are just sailing away . they haven 't sunk us yet , have they ? besides , don 't you worry your pretty little head about that . it 's all been taken care of .
i 'm in to the directory but they 've codified the stockpile -- numerically .
oh , yes , that 's right .
sure ... sure , colonel . now look , i 'm picking up the phone ... nice and slow . right ? ... hello ? ... hello ? hello ? ... hello ? ... gee , it must be edad . probably the lines were hit during the fighting .
general schmuck , we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base , hq 843rd wing . it was apparently directed to their wing on air- borne alert . it decoded as - wing attack , plan-r .
i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you to take the film out .
because i thought it proper , major . why else would you think i 'd do it ?
major , i happen to believe in a life after this one , so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done . i think i can .
zlat , make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices .
forget it , quentin . it can happen to the best of us . now let 's get squared away .
roger , keep calling them . knock off auto-pilot , ace .
we 'll worry about that later . okay , i 'll take damage reports .
lieutenant toejam 's going to help you in a minute . can you check your ecm ?
what the hell are you doing here , lothar ?
so , we 're all old friends of pony 's . we go way back to our childhood .
buff , please , would you jus fuck off , okay ? fuck off !
yeah , we 're just screwing around . like mohammed said . can 't take a joke , man ? hey , i hope you got a permit for that , mama !
ah , that 's nice . they have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of .
don 't drop the guitar , man .
hey , thanks , man .
it does look good .
because i 'm alienated .
no , wait , no , i thought about new york .
that , that 's indian ?
no , no , they , uh , you know , that can be kind of a hassle , so , uh , you know , i just stay at the four seasons . it 's easier .
mine too .
hey , why don 't you swallow your cock and choke on it ? oh , i forgot , it 's not big enough .
there was this other place where they served live monkey brains . sweat to god . you walk in , they bring the little monkey out , shave his head , crack it open , and you eat it 's brains while it 's still alive . i didn 't go in , though , 'cause i didn 't have any money and my mom has a saying : `` don 't write any checks you can 't cash '' .
hee-hee-hee , haaaaa-that 's it ? hee-hee hee ...
mmm-hmmm ...
huh ? oh jesus ...
we were told you could `` fix us up . ''
that 's okay , hannah . it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies . sex - you can learn from movies . but robberies ? there 's no way .
hold on ...
thanks ! that 'd be great .
maybe we can make a deal .
hold up , hold up . any sentence that starts with `` at church camp '' ain 't leading to the big `` o . ''
thank g-d . i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man .
don 't worry . she 's just a fan for my literary output .
goodbye , mr. gillis .
lots of people were . lindbergh had just landed in paris . come on in .
lady . you 've got the wrong man .
or teach it a better tune .
go on in .
thank you , max .
how can you create beauty ... with a selfish heart ? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl 's head , buzzing angrily . her look of delight turns to fear . she tries to shoo the creature away . it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city .
sorry , mistress .
better eat it quick . it won 't look too pretty when it 's all covered with ants .
can i quote you ?
cigarette ?
i seem to be .
for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team , you sure got a big mouth , kent .
me neither ...
look , i don 't know , kent . . . clark personally , i think it could be a terrific story !
actually , that 's why i stopped by . he 's realy sorry , he wanted to make it , but then he ... ran into a problem .
i wouldn 't know mr. kent . most of the people i went to high school with are still in high school .
uh ... yeah . i didn 't think of it that way exactly , but ...
join the party , genius ! come on up !
just a second .
and do what ?
okay , kent , call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home . favoring clark -- happy now , he turns to leave the office . shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice , o.s .
in other words , push this red button .
get a hold of yourself , vera . nobody else ever will .
not quite . what is that in the lower right hand corner ?
mr. smith - -- the `` complimentary couch . ''
say you love me .
do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside ?
he knew . i heard him . i just didn 't listen .
give it another ten minutes . if we don 't -- hell , i 'll tell him . pete ? if we haven 't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt . banner and run the picture for three columns . kent , i need a background story for the page 3 sidebar . give me every thing you know about this terrorist group .
yes .
revenge ! we will kill the son of our jailer !
kill me ? lex luthor ? extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age ? eradicate the only man on earth . . .
now i shall have the son of jor-el as my slave ! forever . if not , the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance . beginning with this one .
it will . starting with your own .
. . . let me get my purse .
you always overreact , clark . how terrible can it be ?
i don 't think 'fan mail ' fits this letter . read it , clark .
you haven 't been at work . . . you didn 't call the office . . . you didn 't even call me . how could you not call back ?
let 's try to keep your i.q . a family secret , leonard . before we launch him against superman , we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction . kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala . and once he proves himself , then . . .
what ?
first , i have fun .
wonderful . otis will go above and steal some big macs .
he 's a good man , ben is . your father always said so .
don 't brag now , jonathan .
it does , huh ? clark kent , i 'd like you to meet lois lane .
it 's a twinkie , boss .
we 'll see how fast i can fly .
because i was driving behind the bus , mary . because i saw it . i saw it happen ...
would you like a cup of tea , billy ? there 's a piece of cake left .
in what way ?
i told you i was positive . the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was .
i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated .
i doubt that it matters any more .
then what are you doing here ? go over there and fight ! if van cleve fires your boy , it gives a lie the ring of truth !
i 'm late for a date with a dame .
hurry back .
no . i 'm going home .
this man is not for you , harvey , and you shouldn 't be seen with him in public . because that 's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space .
i don 't believe it .
you just had a good example of it . a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna .
you mean they 've been fired already , on the basis of this crude smear ?
calculated risk . only we happen to know , j.j. , that you like me . i 'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent .
what kind of an act is this ?
sid ... you got me so ... i don 't know what ...
well , thanks , anyway - let 's forget it . it 's cold out here , susie .
frank thinks i shouldn 't have come here -
don 't you think it 's about time you shut yours ? who are you to tell a man like frank d'angelo to shut up ? !
but i don 't need an uncle , sidney .
what ship ?
but he isn 't going to like this , susie . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i wouldn 't give him a second thought if not for you .
that 's right ! there 's no way i 'm going to finish the new processor now . forget it . i 'm out of it . i 'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow ... i 'll sell real estate , i don 't care , , ,
max .
anything it samples by physical contact .
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves .
and what it that ?
you see , sarah ... here 's the problem . i know how smart you are , and i think you 're just telling me what i want to hear . i don 't think you really believe who you 've been telling me today .
open the goddamn door !
then you 're going to kill me .
don 't talk to me like i was a second violinist . go back into the waiting room . miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you .
it means i wasn 't good enough to be a first violinist .
me ? never . never .
son-of-a-gun . we 'll find the corporal and we 'll find the telegram .
hey , hey , slow up , fraulein straube has to take down what you say .
i won 't let the fat kid down .
we will , kiddo .
what 's it to ya ?
later . i 'm going out for materiel . keep this .
you must have had a fun child-
that can 't be right . that 's the name of the one valley division mopped up this after- noon .
like shit , boss .
did you ? kudos .
don 't . it was a shitty job anyway . i overreacted .
you 're wrong . you 're about to make the biggest mistake of your life . put that gun down .
yes , very lucky .
first they try to kill me , now you ? put your damn clothes back on .
he came to my mind recently , that 's all .
come on . these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist .
it 's somebody 's idea of a joke .
the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection . like he says it 's about one thing , a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia ... and that 'd be a legitimate study , but i think that we 've been subjected to an academic bait and switch ; he 's really looking at something else .
the taj mahal wasn 't a palace , it was a tomb . why didn 't he tell us ?
i have a loft .
i don 't know , you know ...
come on ! why are we waiting ?
all your life . that happened while i swam the length of my pool .
fucking out of order , that . shouldn 't be allowed .
susan .
that 's right , your life is shit , and i 'm to blame . it 's that simple .
pop doesn 't like people smoking in here .
no . i might be interested in that , uh , business proposition --
ed .
look , uh ... creighton ...
so you paid the guy ?
don 't tell 'em anything . we 're getting you freddy riedenschneider .
terrific . your husband backs you up . that 's terrific .
they sent us to tell ya .
i appreciate that .
not so loud .
cuthbert 's counting on the exhibition 's success . the museum is in debt . contributions and public funding have dried up . admissions no longer cover overhead . the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit . cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red . if the superstition exhibit isn 't lucrative , he 'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems .
i don 't believe it .
they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta .
he 's right . follow me .
but at what a price .
someone 's been murdered . not shot , strangled or stabbed , either . torn limb from limb . there 's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal .
it 's deceptively simple . like a bruckner symphony or a matisse .
let me demonstrate some examples .
we accept the reality of the world with which we 're presented . as the show expanded , naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep truman in seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk .
i think i 'm going to stay up for a while .
i 've got something to tell you . you 'd better sit down .
nothing completely conclusive --
you saved me , scully . as different and frustrating as it 's been sometimes , your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times ; have kept me honest and made me whole . i owe you so much , scully , and you owe me nothing . i don 't want to do this without you . i don 't know if i can . if i quit now , they win .
i 'm sorry . my grandson fell and broke his leg .
no . no .
as far as i needed .
okay , okay ...
catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy . when we started , there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as `` receivers . '' all they did was observe and report . nothing more . but catherine , she had the ability to feel what was happening . she understood . and the patient responded . edward engaged her in dialogue , took her places , showed her things . he knew she cared .
it 's his dog .
no , he never told me about his friends . would you like some tea ?
i don 't know .
and my passport ?
we loved each other , do you mean that ?
i 'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident . the only important thing is that he 's dead .
this way , miss .
a roumanian .
well make it your business .
of course , but look ; all these people . if that place existed , they 'd all be there .
was there a shark ? did you see a shark ?
we have free will and intelligence -- which god allegedly gave us ... .
you weren 't complaining about my play last time .
lina , come here !
you eat first , then you light . once you light , it 's yom kippur , which means you 're fasting , so you can 't ... eat .
wow , that 's uh ... great ...
get out of my way .
look , if you want to kill jews on your free time , fine . we need you to raise money . will you do that for us ?
okay .
enzo , stop bitching , will you ?
what does that mean ?
hey ! d'you have any other complaints ? just make a list and we 'll stick it on the porthole ! okay ?
fine !
yes , of course . lots of questions .
... i 'm listening .
c'mon follow me .
relax morty , i think your mom is wonderful . she cares so much about you . get this , while you were gone she said she 'd help me get you to work with the jdl if i 'd come eat by you once in awhile . like i needed any incentive to be with you . she 's so ...
no . it 's not like that . you 're being completely neurotic . i was just playing along ...
i wanted to ask you , how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santa 's workshop ? we 've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years .
oh yeah . take a look .
well that 's good news for us . it means the system is outdated . this should be easy . c'mon .
what arroyo - how did you get to it
that 's the place : i remember - my feet were so darn sore , i couldn 't make it -- and galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
to know where that leopard went - i 'm afraid you 'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard . i was a naturalist . that hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards . i used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back east . i gave that up .
thanks , sheriff .
maybe there ought to be less racket and more us .
if that 's being a softie -- there are two of us .
i 'm no detective . i don 't even know how to begin . all i know is i want to do something about all this .
kiki , galbraith said something to me once , -- something you ought to know . we were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel -- they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves . that 's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way .
a small loan would be welcome . more urgently , i need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me .
shell be alright . shes tough ...
ill call again .
plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education .
how are you , rhian ?
oh , i ... she just moved . ive got her new ... its in my book in the kitchen . wait ... thank you .
if you can , send me a receipt .
i promise ...
jeanne ... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me , those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne !
oh yes , my lady . all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims ... with the holy oil of clovis ... for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven , brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis ...
i don 't know what you 're going to ask me questions about . you may ask things that i won 't want to answer .
my name is jeanne . my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me . i would like to have it back .
and you be careful , you who claim to be my judges , for you too will be judged one day ... !
i am sent by god , and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment . or do you think that you are better judges than he is ?
silence her ! take her away ... !
noooo !
i must offer to the duke . i will give you his answer tomorrow .
i know what i 'm doing , so either lend a hand or go back to bed !
as long as she brings food and supplies , she 'll be welcome .
that 'll put fire in my soldiers !
i care ! and i care because god cares ! all life is precious to god -- even his -- even yours and mine ...
maybe ... i don 't know ... but first we have to confess ...
then , lord dunois , show me the way to the other side of the river ...
i 'd sooner die than use magic !
a few teeth ... that 's the price of his life ?
i said , kneel !
no ... no ... i 'm just a messenger ... he needs me ... a higher calling ...
oh ? you can 't remember ? let me help your memory ...
oh no ? how about this one ?
do you think you are ready ?
oh yes , my sister 's just ... she 's ... wonderful .
okay , then i 'll tell you something funny . you know who i mean by dr. raszeja .
not this week .
god forbid !
stop it , wladek .
no , no they know another track - to the side of this .
don 't worry , we got the wallet . what happened ? he get ya with the knife ?
what am i supposed to do ? call him for cheating better than me ?
did he hold you up on anything ?
i also got ta win .
everybody 'll sit still for somethin ' . what did ya find out about the train , eddie ?
you 're more gutless than i thought .
he cheats .
he 's right , les .
on the nose ! i said place . place it on syphon . that horse is going to run second .
just a minute ...
oh , andy , andy !
oh , thank heaven .
children , will you go into the next room ? i want to talk to chris alone .
oh he as clever about that . he called when you were out . that same afternoon , julia telephoned to him . she said that you were coming , mimi , to ask about wynant . he got terrified . he was afraid that julia would break down and tell ... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant 's watch chain in her hand .
you should have told them he 'd disappeared .
so i did . i saw him lying buried in his shop .
take it easy .
all right ... shoot ! i mean ... what 's on your mind ?
you shouldn 't let that keep you from telling truth , mimi . mrs. jorgensen - were you ever divorced from chris jorgensen ?
i didn 't learn arabic because we were getting shipped here . you don 't learn it in a couple of weeks . i studied it in high school .
can you eat it ? if you can 't eat it i really don 't care what it is .
then get up and do something about it .
doesn 't matter . whatever he wanted he didn 't get it . we 've got no need staying around here . it 's light enough . let 's pack up and head out .
he tried to kill us . if not just now , then in the helicopter . that 's all the authority i need .
you don 't know john epps very well , do you ?
blow me . have i said that to you guys recently ? blow me .
oh my god !
cool it , jaeger . hey , wes ? wes ?
you know what i 'm doing with my part of the gold ?
look at you , not even breaking a sweat . you 're cool , boy . you 're cool .
don 't let me die , epps . i don 't want to die .
yeah , i understand . wes doesn 't want to come along in the first place , but he gets a third of the find . that 's a sweet deal .
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
so good bye , shi'ites . thanks for playing . we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go .
yeah . yeah , that 'll work .
you sure you want me too ?
epps . what if they 're not saudi .
probably .
we 'll make up some kind of lie . they won 't find the gold .
you know what , wes ? if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war .
those soldiers have got loafers on . what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers ?
a car is not just a car where i come from . i had this friend , had this wicked candy apple red sixty-four and a half mustang --
he 'd just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .
you want to say some words ?
but ... you ...
i wonder how far he went . he 's gathered invaluable information out there .
incredible !
no ! ... .
what do you mean ?
thanks .
then let 's go see what they missed .
maybe she knows your old man .
i 'm sorry , detective , but you 're just not my type .
insurance ?
no shit . i better send meg flowers just in case .
shit . we 're fucked .
we 'll keep him pinned in , you guys hurry up !
at once , jacques . we 'll continue later .
i had exactly twenty thousand lire . i had just cashed a traveler 's check and put it in my wallet .
rose might not want to see this , lewis .
lewis ...
the heart of the ocean . cal , it 's ... it 's overwhelming .
i 'd rather be his whore than your wife .
cal , surely you remember mr. dawson .
he does landscapes .
well , that 's the general idea , my dear .
i 'm afraid i 'm feeling a little tired , mr. lovett .
how can you put this on my shoulders ?
i 'm sorry , but you three men can play poker or something . shall i see you tomorrow ?
i 'm just commencing to enjoy this trip .
isn 't that interesting ?
i 'm going down to my cabin . i have to send a wireless -- see you later .
we 'll be expecting you .
not at all .
oh , no -- you 're not gon na give my hard-earned money away .
yes , mr. brett -- right away .
don 't be too smart , jimmy -- you 're out in the rough yourself . you had an argument with lother a couple of hours before he was killed -- but i 'll deal with that later --
why , i --
she 's in new york .
that 's fine .
yeah -- if he 'd only stick to shuffle-board .
not a chance -- i 'm through .
why ed , what an ugly thing to say ! does this mean you 're not my friend anymore ? you know , ed , if i thought you weren 't my friend i don 't think i could bear it .
absolutely nothing .
easy , son . you just need to get your feet back under you , that 's all . come on , boy , let 's kick south . down to the old playground .
well ... 'bye .
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
sheriff , may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates , turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion ? watch your ear , creek .
there 's no reasoning with him .
all right wyatt , maybe you can . but you got ta die to do it . understand ? you got ta die !
it rides right at 'em . like mcmasters said , see it through to the end .
all right , run 'em off .
hope so . clean up with this boy .
i know , kid . i know . me too .
i 'm the one made a mess . made a right fair mess of the whole thing .
hit a streak when we left . him and kate .
just stay calm , use your head . it 'll be all right . just the same , though ... guess you better swear me in .
you might say i 've always been one of mr. valentin 's biggest followers .
i can feel your pain .
sightseeing .
don 't even think about it . 007 . they 're my granddaughters .
i believe q 's exact words were : `` hopefully , nothing . ''
trust me .
'able to topple governments with a single story ' - as he says in his press .
i understand .
we serve the interests of the british people , 007 . no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect .
hopefully , it won 't get that far .
why in the h ...
i don 't know what happened to him . he just ran out into the streets . i got some old records i want you to hear . i like the blues sung simply , man and a guitar . or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life . don 't ever let anyone tell you his life 's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness . when i was a boy , a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i 'll be damned if the same thing didn 't happen to me .
everyone is gone . rhonda is in the bathroom .
babe brother is a poor boy .
no . before anyone moves , you two shake hands and don 't carry it any further .
i 'm going to wash up now . you all please excuse me .
where we come from , you had to know how to act right . you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir . you had to know your place .
you just run along . i 'll fix him his soup . he will be all right .
strange as it may seem , it might have cleared the waters . sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason .
oh , i wasn 't pointing my finger at you . hey , you have to think of yourself . a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep . there are too many bad people out there .
speaking of tappy heads , we ought to have an old fashion fish fry .
whether the boy hears it or not , the man is still a jackass . everyone should have some mother wit .
oh , yeah !
i know andy 's excited about buzz , but you know , he 'll always have a special place for you .
merry christmas , sheriff .
excuse me .
what are you talking about ? where 's that bonding strip ? !
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command ? woody oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ?
oh , you idiot ! you 're a toy ! use your karate chop action !
don 't you get it ? ! you see the hat ? i am mrs . nesbit ! !
outta my way ! here i come , here i come --
of course woody ain 't worried ! he 's been andy 's favorite since kindergarten !
wait ! wait ! i got a better idea ! how about we don 't ? !
hey , these guys are professionals . they 're the best . c'mon , they 're not lying down on the job .
yes sir !
so did i tell ya ? huh ? nothing to worry about .
i didn 't know about the puppets . it 's a lot to take in , all at once .
he 's right . they 'll do it when you 're walking somewhere , make it look like street crime .
that thought makes me feel awful .
they wouldn 't do it in front of all these people . they 'd send someone later , when we 're alone .
as you wish .
it 's all i have .
i hope it won 't come to that , mr. scott .
beam up spock and dr. mccoy . now !
that 's great . i haven 't sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa . what are we going to sing ? what ... bones , what are we going to sing ?
fascinating .
starfleet , are you aware of our currant status ?
maybe you could wait until i 'm a wee bit stronger i don 't think i could take it in my present condition . or yours .
boy , if we were inside , i know how to forge us a group 6 access ...
it can be arranged ...
all right . thank god . alan stayed awake , at least .
lousy utility companies ... they 're the same wherever you go .
not much chance of that now . the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it ...
you 're getting out of the business ?
as long as it gets us out of here
okay . let 's step up the surveillance on her . put on two more guys .
roger , one . rolling .
will you just open the door ! *
yeah , right .
goddammit ! that 's outrageous .
if i break it they can take it out of my pay .
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
yeah . you should have seen it . we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system , the one for the 680 ... how you can write up an order and the second the customer 's name goes into the computer , it starts checking their credit , and if they 've ordered anything in the past , and if they get a discount ...
i 'll handle it .
it 's okay , don 't bother , harry .
oh , sure . fine . i 'll get some more gravy .
i told the guy -- - i told the guy , this isn 't even my order .
well , fuck that shit , we 'll get some real food . what would taste good . what do you think would taste good ?
don 't eat anything .
five .
that rhymes .
nigger , back off , you ain 't beatin ' shit . now what would you do .
yeah , let 's just get outta here .
you 're always making jokes . that 's what you do , isn 't it ? make jokes . making jokes is the one thing you 're good at , isn 't it ? but if you make a joke about this - - i 'm gon na go completely out of my fuckin ' head !
you 're an actor , so act , motherfucker .
pussy love pink rocks .
for a man in your position ... an opportunity .
hey , no problem , it 's probably just another kidnapping featuring jeffrey 's shrink , pardon me , make that ex-shrink . this is your leader , a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for god knows what whacko irresponsible schemes , and now who knows what she 's painted out there on our wall ?
ohhhh , that one ! can we hear that one ?
i 'm not going to `` do '' anything , i promise . but you need help , james . none of this is what you think it is .
no , i want to turn myself in . where is he ? don 't worry -- it 's all okay now . i 'm not crazy any more ! i mean , i am crazy , mentally divergent , actually , but i know it now and i want you to help me . i want to get well ...
in a few weeks , it will have started or it won 't . if there are still baseball games and traffic jams , armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we 'll be so happy , we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police .
christ !
damn . gon na be another hot one today .
sheriff potter .
no trouble at all , really .
you liar ! you wanted him dead . you seduced me into killing him !
you could give me the gun .
get away from me !
i know , mr. vesci . i know . i was on my way to you , it 's just . . . what a day i 've had . you 're not going to believe what 's happened to me . i had the money , i swear i had it . i was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere .
hello ? hello ! ? operator , i got disconnected . hello . . .

christ !

nothing like a little liveliness .
you could give me my gun back .
oh ?
vat ? i am going 5 miles an hour ! i am looking town . i not even moving .
he 's dealing with a lot of things . i think he needs to find answers himself .
characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
fine .
how long have you been married ?
on account of they seen you was beatin ' on their friend .
i ... i guess not . i didn 't mean i didn 't want one 'cause of you bein ' cut up . i didn 't mean that .

oh , them . hell , i seen them .
& lt ; & lt ; i 'll tell you everything . i'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it . just tell this man i want protection . real protection. & gt ; & gt ;
this whole thing was a shakedown .
i don 't want to know .
the way i hear it , soze is some kind of butcher . no pity .
keaton was a piece of shit .

it 's a marble floor , we can clean it up .
i don 't give a damn .
no . i 'm not boyd . i am not cool at all .
today is the best day of the rest of our lives .
however it goes , the point is , nobody says anything to anyone ever . right ? ... right ?
what does that mean ?
no it 's not okay . it 's not .
no . no . no . this is my doing . you see i 'm gon na have my wahoo spark for my own . for lois and the kids , for my brother , for franco . i 'm gon na turn myself in . i am all that . i 'm gon na do it for sweet lois .
i do .
so you didn 't come from the poorhouse !
tell me the answer to this ! what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
thank you , uncle .
today i can refuse you nothing .
it 's up to you entirely . don 't leave , then ...
don jaime loved to watch me skip .
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance , and he has just sent your dowry . does that mean so little to you , viridiana ?
the retreat will start soon . you can leave tomorrow morning .
right , let 's go . and keep the compliments to yourself . i don 't like them .
then i guess we 're even .
i don 't have to do anything except survive . and it 's taking everything i 've got just to do that .
as a matter of fact , it is .
my ... secret .
okay . and she 's alleging ... ?
shoe , boy ... ? you know , you were telling me you wanted beans ? remember , you were concerned about the beans ... ?

they don 't know what 's going on !
i 'd love to , mr. lynch , thank you .
it 's called pasta now dad , spaghetti 's out of date .
i met them before you were born .
too much to do ... but i 'll walk you out .
i think i got some friends that won 't mind making some easy money ...
a pleasure to meet you , mr. fox .
dump it .
get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you 're turning into a yuppie frankenstein , you love money so much .
oh christ !
jesus , can 't make a buck in this market , country 's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around ... too much cheap money sloshing around the world . the biggest mistake we ever made was letting nixon get off the gold standard . putney drug -- you boys might want to have a look at it .
... just kickin ' ass and taking names , mr. mannheim .
cause i have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . i 'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut .
just give it a break china ok ? china jeez . can 't even take a joke
ok toots , i will .
i don 't know .
you sound certifiable . yon know that .

i don 't want it .
i 'm not like you ! i 'm not ! you 're cruel -
it was an accident . gifford , too .
they want to come back . we have a pact - of mutual desire and consent . the mayfairs ar . a beautiful tapestry . i have weaved you all together - from the start . i brought petyr van abel to suzanne . he had genius in him . scientific , precise . it was a perfect start . and on it has gone - father to mother ... sister to brother ... father to daughter ...

as long as you get the hacksaw piece done by friday ... friday ?
i am sorry ...

i think you had better leave
yes - of course .
be cool . fake it if you have to .
yeah , he 's probably been serving cocktails , so to speak , at the orgies .
this is a fun place ... but we don 't usually come here until after the orgies .
of course , dumpling . its very nice of ted but ...
we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after .
consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .
you ordered a winnebago ?
what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in `` heaven ? ''
then you won 't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week ...
seldom ? no kidding ?
it 's about your parents .

it 's a shithole . but she was dirty , what was i gon na do ?
what ? you wouldn 't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter ? cone on . she bought the same story we did ...

you don 't think sam could 've put it there ?
we need to tape the interview , suzie . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that mr. lombardo gave you the ride ?
the line i get on this guy , is that he 's done half the women in blue bay .
police -- god -- get a life .
deal . you know , i just looked out front . my ride wasn 't there . you suppose you could give me one ?
of course i 'm crazy . ask my mom .
hey , come on ... we 've got to have at least one victory party .
there was no way . that cop would 've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...
so suzie , you called us , remember ?
you got something against cigarettes ?
shoulda , coulda , woulda ... get him in the water .
story 's the same , detective ...
goodbye , sandra .
if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion , then i for one am fully prepared to do so ... al fresco .
i 'm going to hit you .
you said it popped out too easily . nothing 's ever good enough for you , is it ?
not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ...
oh , i see , an easy plan !
i don 't like to lose , either .
well , yes sir . a professor morton , but with just a little more time , sir , i can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...
that 'll be all , boys .
exactly . any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth . and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced .
on my way to denver ...
talk ? about what ... ? oh ! about who you are and all that ?
he thought you were a woman , airk !
they 're not after me . they want the baby .
of course ! i promise !
elora danan !

queen bavmorda transformed her .

they don 't have any shit .
that 's a good little girl . i knew you 'd see reason .
destroyed ? toto ? oh , you can 't ! you mustn 't ! auntie em ! uncle henry ! you won 't let her , will you ?
i think i 'll miss you most of all .
i don 't see why not . why don 't you come along with us ? we 're on our way to see the wizard now . to get him a heart .
it 's too late ! there they ... .
she - she can have my witch remover .
hold still - hold still --

i can fairly hear my heart beating !
but how can we find her ? we don 't even know where she is . look ! there 's ... .
don 't cry now . we haven 't got the oil-can with us and you 've been squeaking enough as it is .
i need you to pass me fit now , molly .
shes not a girl anymore .
which is neutral , no doubt .
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met .
you had your chance , james . now im looking for a bigger thrill .

shush .
of course ...

they 'll kill you , you know they will . besides , there is no back door . keep smiling . ready ? now .
he 's a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .

ferrari 's , lamborghini 's ... high end pasta rockets . ten to start .
