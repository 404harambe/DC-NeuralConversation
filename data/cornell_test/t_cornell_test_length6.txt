the embryo , the second form , hosts in the victim 's body for several hours . gestating . then it ... ... then it ... emerges . moults . grows rapidly --
hey ... hey ! look , crowe and dietrich aren 't dead , man .

no , no , please ! it is not a holy relic . you know we have met already ? in this very room . perhaps you won 't remember it , you were only six years old . he was giving the most brilliant little concert here . as he got off the stool , he slipped and fell . my sister antoinette helped him up herself , and do you know what he did ? jumped straight into her arms and said , will you marry me , yes or no ?
because i 've already found the most wonderful libretto !
well . there it is .
this is just a game , papa .
in there , sir .
of course , it 's him . who do you think it is ?
strudel , this is herr mozart . say good morning .
ah , love ! well of course in italy we know nothing about that .
oh no . now for the fire . strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this .

there 's yankees back there . lot 's of 'em .
i got three .
it 's better . it 's a construction depot . they 'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take . that way we can take on a bigger job .

no .
yes , luis is a despicable twit . i hate him .
i think , evelyn , that we 've ... lost touch .
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale can not be , um , corrected , but i have no other way to fulfill my needs .
i know my behavior is ... erratic sometimes .
is that all you ever have to contribute , van patten ? `` what about fucking dinner ? ''
no .
i 'm looking for ... paul owen 's ... place .

he 's working backwards , too . let 's do number five ?
you should 've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects .
oh hi .
i think they call him the `` houseman . '' 'cause `` guard '' sounds too weird .
take a look at this . slightly different approach .
you 're making me young again .
were the flags for teddy ?
'sorry about the late notice ...
you see what 's hanging on the wall ?
there may be a little less trust after your outburst .
longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
i 'm calling gary .
where we going ?
no , i know what you mean . i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers . least they make sense . sometimes you think they 've betrayed you . like a person would . but then you see , no , you just missed a step . you can go back and make it all work .
i thought the worst they would do is fire me . who knew they took termination so literally ?
let 's try # 2 .
wait a second . he knows i know .
groovy .
austin , i have something for you as well .
i couldn 't have another bite .
look at her hands , baby ! those are carpenter 's hands .
not now , austin .
if nature gives a man a collector 's mind , it doesn 't matter what he collects . butterflies . old china . penny farthings . a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass .
something strange is happening . and whoever knows about it doesn 't want us to find out .
and you must be steed . please don 't get up .
yes indeed . i need protection .
thanks ... i see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... hello ?
oh , well ... just my type , mrs. peel .

i 'll catch you up . don 't worry ; he 's expecting you .
snuff . i must insist you try some .
pity your mother came , too ...
mobile hq . in a blue funk . can 't take chances . i 'm looking after things while he 's hiding out ...
it 's mother you have to convince . he 's very agitated . wait here .
this way ...
you wish .
did i ? my mistake .
really -- you went with him for two years .
when do the girls get to the party ?
i 'd like to jerk and press those babies .
you don 't believe me ? okay , fine .
you know your father enjoys his company .
i think i screwed that one once .
that 's more like it .
isn 't he incredible , gets along with everybody .
no sob story is going to change my mind .
she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30 . o'neill , let 's pick up the guys for a drink ... i have major news to announce .
knowing larry , he probably missed the flight .
nothing ... let 's get crazy !
still drawing a blank .
who 's your friend ?
i 'm saved . let 's party !
we 're gon na be okay , man ...
-- you can 't let him turn you against your friends , man --
he 's alive .
it 's old stuff adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway . still good enough though for this tub .
what , are you kidding ? by myself ?
yeah ? well , maybe i can fit it in ...
just take it .
not such a far walk after all , is it , brian ?
pest control .
what are you listening to ?
yeah . in fact , i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterday 's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office . they loved it . and you know what ? you were right , my family background in firefighting gave it weight .
what the hell are we waiting for ?
i know you .
why do i dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death ? and why have i never forgotten that if she , then i --
i 'm on it .
... that simpleton is holding back the race . they got rid of us and keep those two buffoons , mantan and sleep 'n eat , y'knowwhati'msayin ' ?
did he gots to be .
louder . they can 't hear you .
must be the pressure .
and this is manray .
dela , i don 't know 'bout this .
eureka ! !
i thought you had promised mommy you stopped .
he did the best way he knew how , junebug is stubborn just like you .
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer .
i 'm gon na slit my wrists . cut my throat . for the love of joseph .
the pleasure is mine .
that 's why it will be so much fun .
i 'll be right over .
thank you . and always smile .
this show was created , conceived by you , a non-threatening african- american male . voila . end of argument . it can 't be racist because you 're black .
enough .
the gentleman has nothing contraband .
then you must get it .
with pleasure at finding the ribbon .
yes , minister , i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein .
it was the grenade you fucking idiot . look at him !
maybe he 'll be there . either way , we have to go .
none of that matters now . we got two dead bodies and a story that explains them . you 're either with us , or against us -- which is it ?
shut up . west 's dead .
we can still come out of this okay . pike got free , he got a gun , he came after us . that 's the story .
they 're dead , aren 't they ?
yeah --
you wan na bet ?
one went off , yeah , but it didn 't touch him -- i thought you knew this --
don 't know on a map . west told us it was there , we just found it . maybe the hurricane took it away .
west ... he 's dead .
i ...
right in front of us . mueller went after him but we held him back .
there 's that word again . as i told you , i wasn 't in the room when everyone started shooting .
i was just thinking of what 's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you .
because i was standing next to him .
fantastic . you want to tell me what 's going on ?
microrecorder for kendall -- didn 't have time to wire his room . now tell me why you joined the army or i 'll jab this pen through your neck .
yeah . that 's just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed . truth is ... i don 't know . the whole honor and duty thing . make a difference in the world , crap like that . didn 't really work out .
have no fear , osborne , we have not yet begun to fight .
because it 's my job . because people are dead . because of the whole honor and duty thing , make a difference in the world , crap like that . we can do this , hardy .
see , i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls ; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall 's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
no death certificates . no crime .
seven .
in case you need me to testify about the shooting . they 'll clear you .
yeah . but he was a lot of other things , too . thanks .
although that won 't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
what , `` the truth '' ? please . there are degrees of truth , officer , always degrees . things are not what they seem .
we 've been making progress , i see .
no , but it got you interested , didn 't it ? got you to dig . inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn 't belong .
then he 's mistaken . you know , i really don 't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
it will and you know why ? because you 're not a person anymore , you 're a cadet in the united states army ; you have no identity , no miranda warning , and no rights . so i 'm gon na throw you to the wolves , and unlike you , i 'm gon na get away with it , because you 're pissing me off !
childs .
he came after us . and i told dunbar he had to kill him ...
what the fuck are you doing ?
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
no --
it 's too neat .
gets on his plane in ten minutes , which means you two are done . you 'll understand if i don 't walk you out .
kid , you were a big fish in a small pond . this here is the ocean , and you 're drowning . take my advice and go back to puddleville . you 'll be happy there .
not yet .
absolutely . be good for you to talk to him .
how did you know ?
beats me .
it 's rude to talk about religion . you never know who you 're going to offend .
the river ?
story of my life .
don 't need to apologize to me . i mean , i 'm the luckiest person you 're going to find today ...
i see . we need to get you one of those plant misters . we can spray you like a fern .
there is no softer ground than town .
i am . and you 're will . i 've seen your picture , that 's how i recognize you . i almost said something at the store , but it would have been awkward . like this .
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication .
he just fell asleep . josephine 's with him .
fifty thousand . almost exactly .
yeah .
thank you .
he says he feels safe here .
toast first then we talk seriously , i can see you are serious about us .
sorry ?
happy bath day .
yes i know .
i don 't have any money .
i don 't know why i said that . she 's not dead at all .
goodbye .

maybe you will find out .
sophia . hello sophia . mine 's still john .

well , dig in , son . got plenty to eat .
let go ...
the wolf ?
saving your life .
where is the subway station , please .
no .
you said that in the last two places .
i hope not .
yeah ... i came to save you . if you 're hopeless , i 'll pull the plug .
i wasn 't expecting you .
they made you leave your hotel ... ... you caused a disturbance .
i stole them .
he says they 're very nice . he wants to know if you have anymore .
there she is !
you were too far behind .
i can 't ...
i called ohashi , he 'll be waiting . i like him waiting .
now we 've got nothing to negotiate with .
luck .
joyce , give the assistant chief inspector a drink , would you ?
there was a change in plans .

it 's got caffeine in it . that 's all i know .
saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans , with outlawed pipes , playing outlawed tunes .
no . but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything . the balliols will kiss his ass , so we must .
he will . i know he will .
you are surprised he would lie ? balliol was murdered in a church yesterday . you are longshanks ' new designate . you will be king .
impossible . how dare you bring a panicky lie .
look at me . i said look at me !
grant , as you do everything else , with treachery . offer him a truce to discuss terms , and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary . he trusts me . pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along . and i will set the meeting , and the ambush .
aye .
i will not .
i should'a remembered the eggs .
your pardon , m'lord , he asked me to come in his stead .

not in this wing , actually . no .
what are you talking about ? what you deserve is a better brother and father . all they do is make you feel like shit .
yeah , i think i got ta get these fixed or something .
maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function , it 'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain .
it was like tommy was possessed or something . there was a hate in his eyes that i couldn 't really call human .
sorry , mrs. t. he 's been out of sorts lately .
oh my god oh my god ...
aw , hey now , that was a compliment .
-- he 's just a lucky guy .
but we who are still free will do all we can . we are organized , monsieur , underground like everywhere else . tomorrow night there is a meeting at the caverne du bois . if you would come ...
it has been a pleasure to meet you .

i figure , if we could take care of a puppy , we could , you know , take care of --
malaysia . they 're holding the sweep .
that 's my sea anchor . my second one . made it out of part of the sail . it keeps you from capsizing in a storm . in theory . and this , this i used to collect water . about half a cup a day .
that 's what i told the fish i caught . but i ate them anyway .
great . really .
i don 't know . i really don 't know .
you bet i do . high tide comes right up to this road .
yeah .
mom , meet jango .
great . terrific . the good guys won one for a change .
it was fifteen minutes late .
you beat 'em to shit , pal ! jesus !
you should have smelled me .
to wilson .
digital laser readers . wow . terrific .
no sweat .
she died of *secrecy* , she died of *ignorance* ...
candy . candy kendall .
two .
i 'm *never* bored ! it 's all very ... different for me ... here .
i don 't think mr. rose would leave without you .
well , she was in a weakened condition ... i don 't know ! what about `` king kong '' ? ! is that medically possible ?
right .
oh , he 's fine ! i just heard from him . he 's bombing all these places ...
i love you , too . see you tomorrow .
you *bet* it 's a heavy sedation ! the fetus is unexpelled , her uterus is punctured , she has acute peritonitis , and there 's a foreign object . i think it 's a crochet hook .
i 've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet -- that 's the first mountain pass .
and i *love* her ! there ain 't nobody else gon na treat her as good as i do ! i wouldn 't do nothin ' to hurt her , homer -- you must know that .
obviously .
you know everything i know , plus what you 've taught yourself -- you 're a better doctor then i am and you know it !
just promise me that , if there 's a blizzard , you 'll move into wally 's room until it 's over .
pretty , ain 't it ? you a plumber ?
i can 't read . nobody taught me .
yeah , you is . i know when people is in trouble , and you is .
*no* ! i don 't want to know him ! he 's doing *missionary* work -- in *india* ! i wrote him *weeks* ago , but he 's either too holy or too busy to answer . maybe he got killed in the war !
it 's encephalitis b . he 's recovering at mount lavinia hospital , ceylon . uh ... captain worthington is paralyzed . waist down . he won 't walk .
well , muddy , we can look at all these angry stars homer 's been readin ' to us about .
you need some convincing . consider it a convincer .
factors that weren 't clear to me until now .
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy . the same numbers everyday for sixteen years . one day he gets pissed off , tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers . they hit the lucky seven for one point two million .
fine . but only if we recover the cash .
we 're going to give him the money back ?
so far , masters of our own demise . what bank are you with ?
let 's go , jake ?
so what ? we just stay clear of him .
two million .
no , not `` whatever . '' you 're either in or you 're out .
she 's up for it .
that 's it .
no , you listen . we 're partners now and even though i 'm running the show for you , i 'm still running the show . that means i get a little respect . so i don 't want to hear anymore of this scooter , buddy , junior , skippy , tiger , bullshit . it 's jake . and i got ta tell you , for a guy who spends all his time in a gym , you could be in better shape .
i said take off your fucking shirt .
jake . jake pearson . i go to lawschool with your daughter . carolyn . we met once or twice .
listen to me ! we don 't have much time . we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me !
what about this situation makes you think i can answer that question right now ?
you interested in a little work ?
hey , i got it ! take some mental notes . you just might learn something here .
honey , this is mr. lewis . carolyn lewis 's father . mr. lewis , this is my wife , lily .
no , i 'm not going to take it easy . you can 't stay clear of this guy . he will be on this until the end of time .
you sure we 're clear ?
no , the corporate papers have to be legit . but you got ta score an i.d . a clean one . talk to suits . i got ta get us a banker .
oh , you know ... don 't fuck this up . i 'll kill you . i 'll kill your family . i 'll shoot your dog ... all the usual . then he said good luck .
what are we gon na do with this stuff anyway ? heroin ? what the hell do you do with heroin ?
you are officer richard rottovich . and this would be officer walter sobozinski . i 'm looking for jake vig .
we 're here .
it 's the tension .
all men are cheats .
hey . i 've got an idea . why don 't we ...
you mean i won 't resist them .
i don 't know .
fine .
it 's only hair . i haven 't changed .
haven 't you got a conscience of your own ?

and i saw that i was alone .
ah , negative drop .
okay , doolittle , i 'll have it in a minute .
calm down , talby . i 'm coming .
now that that 's out of the way ... you want the woman , here 's how it works . you pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever , and i make a call to bring her in .
where ?
it was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued , causing you to maybe take offense .
police drone .
don 't look down .

and for all his cattin ' around , not much of a stick man either .
can we go somewhere and talk ?
the one you 're wearing ?
open it .
what ?

i 'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause i 'm not feeling so hot .
you mean you never seen a jack daniels on the rocks before ?
thanks .
my dad 's company is relocating him . we 're moving . that 's why i was acting so freaky in school today . i thought it was the last time i 'd ever see you . anyway , open the box . i would have given it to you this morning , except ... like i said , i was freaking out .
plenty , but it was all bad .
i 've been in love with her since the second grade .
the paint !
tickets ?
and if it ain 't cleaned off ?
christine stole it ! asleep , my ass ! the stella booted with your mom 's wheels .
uh-uh . don 't tell us , jam . just show us .

simple-icity is more like it . and you guys thought jam was in trouble before . wait till mrs. bruce finds out he went to that concert with us .
i can see that , bright boy . what happened to it ?
all i got is five . the rest is in the volvo .
donnie . donnie darko .
a metal craft of any kind .
i can do anything i want ... and so can you ...
a hundred and one , i think . every day she does the same thing . but there 's never any mail .
sure .
i 'm going home .
i don 't want to talk about it . so what happened to your neck ?
what ?
yeah , they told me to get out of the house .
where are we going ?
yeah ...
if you don 't complete the assignment , you 'll get a zero for the day .
when did you stop taking your medication ?
that is a terrible nickname .
grandma death .
you know , roberta sparrow . we almost hit her with the car the other day .
a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit .
sometimes it 's the only thing that keeps us going .
donnie ? you 're a dick .
go back to china , bitch !
raspberry .
mom , look , don 't say anything . first of all , i 'm not pregnant .
we all do . now let 's go .
okay . take her purse .
`` proud ... to be ... an ... american . ''
none of your business ... take another letter .
all right -
i didn 't come here to be insulted .
i 'll join you shortly .
do you ?
dinner will be served , shortly , dear .
shut up !
and what was that , john ?
not me , sir . mr. merrick . he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness .
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies , thou anointest my head with oil ...
no , but i certainly shall .
good morning .
but the variety of food here is very pleasing ... i commend you .
there is one more thing , john . here .
john ... . how can you ever forgive me ?
you too , my friend . goodnight .
yes ! the workhouse !
i regret that i must leave you here , m ' lord , m ' lady . thank you so much for coming . it was an act of the greatest charity .
i ... i don 't know what you mean , sir .
there 's nobody here , father . look for yourself .
i mean , you could have killed yourself .
why ?
the second note to wake the gods ...
the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores , the whole of hy-brasil will sink beneath the waves .
yes ?
the important thing is not to panic .
i don 't know ! i just did !
find it ... and cross it !
come on , move it !
i know . snorri ! get your oar out !
very deep ... usually ...
you mean if just one person gets killed ?
sorry !
you may need a real berserk .
row !
look out !
now you 've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other .
to the oars !
oh ... i feel a little ... oh ...
keitel blacksmith ?
but how could he know ... unless ...
but ...
i don 't know -- but i 'm not afraid to try .
we haven 't got a spare place .
she must have a knife or something ...
i ... i ...
well ... i ... i thought ...
stop it !
me too .
erik 's right ! we 'll all meet in valhalla .
hi , joel . so no jokes about my name ?
hi .
nothing is wrong with you . you 're the most wonderful person i 've ever met .

you 're a whiz kid . so perceptive , so --
thanks , joely . a present ! oh boy !
hi .
i 'm joel .
i love you .
i know . i spoke to my friend magda .
there you are . naomi , it 's just ... i 'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had ...
there are two of them . couldn 't make them out . the orange glow of a cigarette .
it 's too late .
is that like us ? are we just bored with each other ?
i loved you on this day . i love this memory . the rain . us just hanging .
i 've got to finish this chapter anyway .
hi , mary . how 's it going ?
i never saw you together like that again . so i figured i was imagining things .
thanks , mary . you can bring her in .
no you 're right . once again . you 're a decent man , howard .
we ... have a history . i 'm sorry . you wanted the procedure . you wanted it done ... to get past . i have to finish in there . it 's almost morning . we 'll talk later .
then check the connections .
yeah , that looks better . thanks .
it 's a quote book .
you might say that , although i don 't think of it as traveling .
oh , rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home .
no , ma'am . no way . there 's girls on the rubber rose who are political , but i don 't share their views . i got no cowgirl ideology to expound . `` politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it . ''
from men , the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect . men have drained the crane 's marshes , stolen its eggs , invaded its privacy , polluted its food , fouled its air , blown it apart with buckshot .
you bet your raggedy white ass i am .
i heard it .
you 're convinced the crew could still be alive ? after seven years ?
i 'll get him .
it is not .
i don 't know , the screens are dead ... !
run !
his vitals are stable , but he 's unresponsive to stimuli . he might wake up in fifteen minutes . he might not wake up at all .
nothing . it 's nothing .
a power drain --
you didn 't hear it ? you must have heard it !
almost done , i just got ta check one thing ...
dr. weir , admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible .
clear and open on my mark . three ... two ... one ... mark .
ice crystals everywhere . this place is a deep freeze .
starck , you still showing those readings ?
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message ...
negative .
they 're empty , dr. weir . moving forward .
i noticed . starck , anybody home ?
keep your eyes open .
but you can breathe it .
there was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you ... you saw what you saw . we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged . what if there were a connection between the two ? the gravity waves , the hallucination , all part of an defensive reaction , like an immune system ...
whatever was on that bridge wasn 't weir .
no . i 'll be right back .
i did .
can you shut it down ?
come on , baby-bear , open this door ...
dead ahead , 5000 meters .
that 's the core : the gravity drive . the heart of the ship .
we 're losing atmosphere ...
all boards are green , everything 's five by five .
the law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel ...
wrong . the shortest distance between two points ...
ship 's log .
i don 't know . the life readings just went off the scale .
it wants me . i have to go .
my step-dad 's . i 'm strictly into stone . i was wondering when you 'd walk by .
victor must 've taken him .

i think i need to lie down . bad shrimp .
yeah , nine years straight .
ben ! ben !
i can go hotter !
please tell me you go silent too .
okay , `` mom . ''
i think that thing is ben .
dude . that 's my sister .
blockhead started it !
you are such a dork , reed ... you never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics .
the plants , from space . their particles are still charged . with the right amount of energy , those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm .
what i should have done a long time ago . applications and patents , reed . this all belongs to me .
i think you both know my director of genetic research , susan storm .
victor , are you feeling alright ?
it is . there 's something we need to talk about . something i need to ask you ...
later .
sis .

naked .
the medicine ? yes , it 's right here .

you bastard ! they 'll never let us back in that place . i leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles ! you scared the shit out of those people ! they were ready to call the cops . hell , the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there ...
it won 't stop . it 's not ever going to stop .
it can 't be helped . this is lucy . you know -- like `` lucy in the sky with diamonds . ''
man , you don 't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice !
you won 't need much . just a little tiny taste , that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer . adrenochrome .
never missed a plane yet .
of course , officer .
they 'll get in ! we 'll all die !
um , yeah , thirty miles east .
we 're going to get my little girl .
hey . you noticed that no one 's been killed or maimed for awhile ?
we 're lucky to be alive .
if we move in a group , we are one target . if we scatter , they can 't get us all .

smile , little sister , smile .
not long .
i promise i 'll ... i promise , mama .
among persons such as yourself , creative people under great stress , erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of . it 's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which ...
you didn 't say 'symington says ' .
sedate her .
her body pleases me .
and you look so lovely .
fine .
he set things right with a proper apology ... and now they 've put him in charge of dissection lab !
let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night i left . he 's coming home to marry me .

of course i am . it pays to humor the insane .
i didn 't find what i was looking for .
numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system ?

i walked into it knowing i 'd get hurt , but i thought i could stand anything . i just wasn 't ready for that kind of pain . we were supposed to meet in l.a . when i got back there , he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife .
absolutely .
some campers drowned . then some counselors got killed .
don 't burn that gorgeous body , or i 'll scratch your eyes out ...

i call it my shower dream .
just a little . wait a minute , woman .
yeah , and it also look like it hasn 't seen a coat of paint in six years .
those things can be nasty .
nothing . i didn 't make a statement . i asked a question . would you like me to ask it again ? very well . are you such a loser you can 't tell when you 've won ? the entire state of texas , along with the fbi , is looking for you . did they find you ? no . they couldn 't . they had every entrance to the border covered . there 's no way you could get across . did you ? yes , you did . you 've won , seth , enjoy it .
to yours .
yep .
kate , scott ?
so all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door .
scott ?
we 're having a wet bikini contest , and you just won .
the sword of damocles is lifted from above seth 's head . he 's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable . he knows exactly how he 's going to cross the border . whistling a happy tune , he turns and walks back into room # 9 .
anytime .
me too .
later .
well that don 't matter now , 'cause you got about two fuckin ' seconds to live ! richie !
i kinda doubt that . we 're grabbin ' a table , send over a waitress to take our order .

congress and the pentagon share a lot of plumbing . they 'll never know whose leak it is .
well , i 'm just an old dame without much time left , so you 'll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type . i am deeply concerned over the navy 's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military . case in point ...
i feel like there 's men here , there 's women here -- then there 's men . but hey , what 'd i expect ?
i don 't know ...
i 'm lookin ' , i 'm lookin ' !
you heard me . move on .
show us where you are , chief .

look , you want to make it up to your friend ? well if he 's right , this is your chance .
lucy 'd kill me if she knew .
it 's the maintenance entrance . runs along the side of the tunnel . when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it .
you must have quite some harem .

i know a way . i know how you can get a message out of here .
oh , please , your life doesn 't suck . his life sucks .
nick tatopoulos .
ah , elsie chapman , paleontologist .
more than that . i believe this is a mutated aberration , a hybrid from the fall out in that region .
you 're standing on it .
it happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over .
no , it 's still in my tent . it 's ... oh my god , she took it .
thanks .
i can 't get through . i don 't know what 's wrong .
it 's okay . i know her .
you 'll forgive my impertinence , sir , but even though we had never before met , always considered you as a father to me .
friend . you stole all my best lines . you cut me out of episode two entirely ! ..
come in protector ... protector ...
like throwing gasoline on a fire ...

i played richard iii ...
no . i can 't go out there ! i won 't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time . i won 't . i can 't !
no , jason , that 's a wrap ! there 's nothing to think about !
the engines are dead . we 're drifting .
the guy is terminally selfish !
the ships are gaining ...
front armor is gone ! just slow it down a little !
nobody was watching ?
okay , you can go on in ... i 'm going to get kyle . he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive .
okay , that 's where you want to be .
yes commander ... all right , you 're almost there . just go through the chompers and over the pit .
we 're getting major structural damage .
the enemy is matching velocity .
all systems are working , commander .

hopkins can 't drink your bathwater fred .
i don 't like this ... i don 't like this at all ...

i 'm trying commander ... everything 's a blur , but as long as i stay locked to that vox signal ...
patience , lt. . patience .
well , sir , then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear .
congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and can not pay the soldiers pensions .
he has the soul of an aristocrat who 'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people !
george ! so good to be back !
my baby daughter has died ... my baby ... mon petite henriette ...
and have you heard anything from our dear friend , sally ? what with all the rumors getting back to england . i thought she might inquire after us . but then i believe she always looked down on us .

the money . fuck . i got ta think ...
she can 't talk right now .

i don 't know about his wanting to meet celebrities , that 's something new . but , yeah , he comes to l.a. then after that , i don 't know what happens .
she 's a rock star . every day , same time , they come down here and have breakfast . he has the egg white omelet ; she has the banana pancakes . he sits facing west so he can see his billboard . she faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades .
that 's not bad . i think you got it down .
what happened ?
because a movie star can never order straight from the menu . they have to think of something they have to have that isn 't on the menu .
guy 's got a fucking pink toilet , for christ 's sake .

because of the gold .
salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks . at least . who knows , could be more . could be a lot more . what i 'm proposing is ... we split it four ways .
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this .
yup .
i 'll call us in . dodge , see how many signal flares you can scrounge up . keep an eye on him .
but , who -- ?
right here .
crazy with greed . not crazy . not like him .

if it 's a person , why should we go see it ? it 's not like it 's nature or anything . it 's just a person . sometimes people who live in the woods don 't want to be seen . they live in the woods because they 're anti-social , lila . we have to respect that .

nothing . just the cyclist . he 's passed us .
he 's not the problem . it 's the van in the back .
whatever you do , just ... don 't stop .
then what are you stopping for ?
how do you act when someone trys to kill you ?
yeah . al wants to talk to you !

composition of the sand , ... trace elements..unique ...
you 're out of shape .
she 's beautiful ... ! what do i do ?

well , don 't let it . what are you doing ?
losing power . the laser drained it .
you 've changed your mind .
yeah , sure .
sending what we know back to u.s.t . via satellite .
face it , we 're the men for the job . besides , if someone is really chasing you , the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ... and find the goddamn pem .
ryuji bandaio . grown near here .
aren 't we all .
don 't give her your name .
i insist .
don 't worry .
look , i don 't know how we 're gon na get out of this .
i know we fight , but i don 't mean it . you 're quite a guy . no one else could have dealt with this .
trouble ... is , if we both get stuck here .
what a nerve !
i dyed it . we 're all getting old .
we 'll let you go . you leave the pods and the pem .
i came for a rest . as , i imagine , you did . to get away with it all .
you ... him ... ust .
yessir ... very good sir .
yeah . one of the corniest lines i ever heard .
yes , of course .
i just work for the travel firm .
beats me .
where would you go to sell a chip ?
i 've never met anyone like you .
her ?

could have been drunk a little sooner , but excellent ... good character ... what is it ?
thank you .
she was playing with my pooh doll again ...
yeah . catch you later .
it 's not a rumor . it 's a sale . if tisch can unload cbs for $ 81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from brown & williamson , that could screw up the sale , could it not ?
i 'm not implying . i 'm quoting . more vested interests ... `` persons who will profit from this merger ... ms. helen caperelli , general counsel of cbs news , 3.9 million . mr. eric kluster , president of cbs news , 1.4 million ... ''
you alright , mr. wigand ?
`` mike ? ''
catch you later .
i told him that you had an e-mail death threat that said if you didn 't shut the `` f '' up , they were going to kill you ...
will he go on-camera and talk about the mexico city branch ?
hello ? yeah ...
... '' ignition propensity ? '' ... you understand any of this ... ?
jeffrey ...
no . no , it 's okay ... how 's -- how 's the new place ?
what chance is there of getting jeff 's interview on the air ... ?
how are the rooms ? comfortable ?
no , i usually sit around in my hotel room , dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning , sleepy look on my face .
you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years .
that 's room service . they usually knock first . come on in ... over here , please .
you okay ?
tempura ...
they 're terrorizing us . death threats ? ! to my family ? my kids ? !
i 'll call them , lowell .
everything ... you ... say ! and i can 't defend you , man , with one hand tied behind my back ! because you keep from me ... what they can discover . and they will discover everything ! believe me .
you 're breaking up . i can 't hear you .
for example . james burke , the ceo of johnson & johnson ... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in tylenol bottles , he didn 't argue with the fda ... he didn 't even wait for the fda to tell him . he just pulled tylenol off every shelf of every store right across america . instantly . and then he developed the safety cap ... because , look , as a ceo , sure , he 's got ta be a great businessman , right ? but he 's also a man of science . he 's not going to allow his company ... to put on the shelf ... a product that might hurt people . not like the seven dwarfs ...
someone put a bullet in my mailbox .
you know , miles , after my wife -- wife 's mastectomy -- things were never the same . this might sound cold , well , maybe not to you , massey , but ... i like my women with two boobs .

mr. dumbarton is , yes .
no ...
i should be in therapy .
ruth rabino .
it 's about time .
i think ming is older than tong . what is this ?
i 'll be right back .
positano is beautiful . remember when we were there , rex ? we stayed in the santo pietro ? that hotel on the cliff ?
not according to mrs. rabinow .
have you ever met mr. rexroth ?
what kind of `` stuff ? ''
you have some ?
jesus .
please !
now ? she 's a night manager at mcdonalds .
oh , god !
i 'm dying .
no . i 'll see some blood before this is over , but it won 't be mine .
it 's not ming . it 's tong .
when you have a moment .
oh , just a routine mammogram . she said to say hello . she 's going to positano with your brother 's family .
kirshner does not apply . kirshner was in kentucky .
rephrase . mrs. rexroth , have you ever been in love ?
we 've outlined a settlement ...
please -- let me handle this . okay , ruth , forget kirshner -- what 's your bottom line ?
hard to believe i know . i 'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters .
well , not just divorce . she used to say `` i want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy ... '' and i guess her dream is coming true . i 'm happy for you patty
i haven 't the slightest idea .
i met some very interesting women at the showers . we got to chatting about this and that . you know how time files .
now watch me . i 'm going to use number one . keep your eye on that thumb , baby , and see what happens .
just your imagination .
bridge washed outaround dawson .
yeah , you 'll have to git .
yeah . clay . i met him sometime in june of '62 at the masquerade bar . dave ferrie took me there , for the express reason to meet him .
to frame him , obviously . you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think , bill ! they 're not ordinary crooks .
oh man , why don 't you stop . this is too fuckin ' big for you ! who did kennedy ? it 's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma . even the shooters don 't fuckin ' know ! don 't you get it yet ? i can 't be talking like this . they 're gon na kill me . i 'm gon na die ! i don 't know what happened . all i wanted in the world was to be a catholic priest - live in a monastery , study ancient latin manuscripts , pray , serve god . but i had this one terrible , fatal weakness . they defrocked me . and then i started to lose everything .
there 's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared , jasper , virginia . telling the truth can be a scary thing . it scared president kennedy , but he was a brave man . if you let yourself be too scared , then you let the bad guys take over the country , don 't you - and then everybody gets scared .
bugging the district attorney 's office of new orleans ! it 's outrageous !
i know .
well ... yeah .
boss , the president 's been shot . in dallas . five minutes ago .
graveyard dead near big sandy , texas in '65 . two in the morning on some highway . a hit and run .
and it ain 't pretty ... '' the ad has spent more than $ 8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november , 1966 .
you just need some sleep , lou . it won 't look so bad when ...
yes , you have a suit i 've had my eye on .
hey , jackie .
if i were to tell you `` no it isn 't ... ''
oh , you 're both ? in 1985 you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs . you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours . he did time and you got off . but that ended your career with the big airlines . cut to thirteen years later . you 're forty-four years of age . you 're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is . where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year . that ain 't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career . and to top it off , you 're going to jail . now true , the judge , even with your prior , will probably only give you a year or two . but this doesn 't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away . now , we don 't like trying losers like they 're criminals . but in the absence of a criminal , we will try you . now , wasn 't this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker ?
while you 're at it , let me see what else is in there . you mind ?
that 's my diet shit .
help you get ordell robbie .
i think maybe i have more options than i thought .

yeah .

not every day ?
yeah ?
i thought you were going to let this one through .
who you think got your ass outta jail ?
all your money 's in mexico .
sure .
yeah , there 's another hit left .
what 's a metrix ?
sure .
yeah .
all right already .
okay , you got it . just take a chill pill , for christ sake .
who 's your partner ?
over half-million dollars worth of merchandise .
where would you like me to put my ash ?
beaumont . that 's the only name i know .
you go wait in the car . wait a minute .
is that what i think it is ?
mister robbie , isn 't it ? i have the ten thousand you put up . isn 't that why you called .
looky here , i know you helped her and i know you know what i want . jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers . long as at the end of that story , she hands over my money . she do that , we 're still friends . now , she don 't wan na be my friend no more , tell her to think about ol ' louis . and if she tries to turn me in , i 'll name her ass as my accessory . we 'll go upstate together . hand in handcuffed hand . now that shit 's a promise , understand what i 'm sayin ' ? you tell her that , and i 'll call you back .
git your ass in here .
it 's beaumont .
'ola !
let me speak to max cherry .
no ! oh god .
i think something 's fucking connect- ed . i mean , a car tried to run me over the other day . doug too , right ? we 've got six guys here going fucking crazy .
an explosion , just like paul 's .
okay , not you rod . but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason . they 're tryin ' to kill us . fuck it man , we need to find out what 's going on .
thanks .
if i could stop it , i 'd stop it .
that you 'd die on the way to the hospital . now get into that tub .
what kind of man are you ?
here . i 'll do it .
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable , dr. singer .
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable , dr. singer .
that 's what i 'd like to know . if you see him on the street somewhere , tell him he 's fired .
what ? !
i 'm looking for dr. carlson . isn 't this his office ?
he 's either unconcious or playing dead , whichever , he ain 't really dead . okay , you know , that 's it for me . i 'm outta here .
then break it ! if you don 't pull it , the ship 's going to depressurize !
that 's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship .
thorgan , pull us in .
and you said high school was boring .
briggs , geko , movement beyond the boxed fuselage .
where 'd you get the gun ?
i think i broke my arm .
we could convert fission transistors .
bring 'em all . let 's move !
you tell me ! she 's only set one charge . and it 's not finished !
and now we 're all out of it .
suit up .
not so fast yllo ! there 's a protocol here .
weapons ? all this technology and what good has it done ? !
oh man , what the hell happened ?
negative .
i 'm pulling , damnit !
we have to get off this ship .
isn 't there an escape pod on this ship ? something ?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do ? !
what if we don 't ?
it 's better this way . if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship . you want him on your precious earth ii ?
it 's the engine , reactors , audiometers , it 's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom .
well , we 'd be dead without you . you know that , don 't you ?
i 'm stuck !
we wait . i need about fifteen . call me if there are any changes . if she farts i want a full report .
she broke my fucking nose !

just come on , i 've got an idea .
kay-em , you 've saved our lives , you know that don 't you ?
forget her , she 's a pain in the ass . let her hang there .
go , go , go !
remember to roll his balls around a bit .
shit ! temp 's dropping ! we should have left this rock an hour ago !
that ought'a help the situation .
you 're leaving me here alone ?
jesus ! can 't you knock ? diminish power to shutttle beowulf .
you need to get laid !
don 't worry about me . i live for this shit .
oh , goody . i 'm so pleased . i 'd clap if i could .

i did the prep questions for this lab last night . you can copy my answers if you need to .
well , i do .
what ?
no , i mean the father ! who 's the father , juno ?
but i 'm going to give it up for adoption . i already found the perfect people .
you should have gone to china . i heard they give away babies like free ipods . they shoot 'em out of those t-shirt guns at sports events .
sure .
sure . it 's the right size and everything . i even saw its phalanges today ! check this ...
the baby ? i don 't know anything about it yet . i only know it 's got fingernails , allegedly .
well , no ... i 'm not going to sell the baby . i just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents . i 'm in high school , dude . i 'm ill-equipped .
well , of course . your old d-a-d ! you know i 'll always be there to love and support you , no matter what kind of pickle you 're in .
it 's extremely complicated , and i 'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state .
yeah , but it sucks for free .
no way . no , i definitely don 't want to know .
what ?
juno just wanted a closer look at kimber here .
i suppose anything 's possible .
carrie .
early grayce if this ain 't your lucky day .
could i try that ?
took 'em all .
early , you are so sweet .
they ain 't dangerous adele . they 're writers .
early , can we stop there ... just for a little while .
she had a dream that somethin ' like this was gon na happen .
best kind .
... then some .
they picked up hitchhikers ... young men ... and brought them back here .

good luck .
no . i just got ta go find him .
hi telly . where you been ?
yes .
let 's see how much he wants to play .
get off me !
could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal ?
it 's a voice modulator .
i 've got a feeling we 're going to go the distance with him . let him sweat for a little while .
he 's one of the best chess players in the world . who better to play a game with ?
you couldn 't find your dick in a wind storm !
just a second . hello ?
set up some pieces on the big board ?
have computer search for anyone that 's used that opening against me . there can 't be more than a handful .
new york . 1986 . viktor yurilivich .
he went down to the lobby for a minute . he should be right back . would you like come in ?
of course .
nice meeting you .
my cheering section .
nothing .
who 's kathy ?
it 's important .
yes . why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure ?
what are you saying ? that i 'm seeing what i want to see ? that i 'm protecting a murderer ? what ?
it 's over , peter . let 's stop the games . i 'm not sending a car .
call room service .
the line was busy . i 'll try again .
colwyn .
no . they watch me closely , but they haven 't harmed me .
all directions are the same here .
that way . i can feel the cold .
yes .
you can 't reach her ! through the door . quickly !
yes . they will be more help than high-born barons .
she is too deep . the curved tunnel we saw is part of the vortex , the place of the beast .
lyssa , your bracelets . bend them straight and cross them .
i found the body of the seer in the stream .
yes . it is today .
each to his fate .
and mine goes with you .
smart lad . bring me my spices !
oh , my poor stomach .
he will not come . you will be my queen .
he leads a group of slayers , under the leopard banner .
yes . it is the western ocean .
no . they are sad , solitary creatures , rarely seen .
fewer will survive them .
ynyr !
yes .
then the other lyssa will share your fate . she will grow old in the fortress as you have grown old here .
good .
oh really ? but can you miss the car ?
yeah ... come on , have a little training .
whoever .
ok .
of course , so kiss me quickly , or they 'll notice us .
yeah ... i 'm just good for left-overs !
well ... i proposed them to play roulette ... like we played ... ... and i lost .
i prefer waiting for a while ... i feel it would go the wrong way .
... don 't you like me ?
i have no fear .
fine ...
giancarlo ... rinaldi .
... even his mother wouldn 't .
adelle ... maurice is in the paper .
uncle , the way i was told , if that police car didn 't happen down that road , you would be dead right now . that guy denny , had jumped bail in another state , he 's dangerous ... they 'll be other dennys , if you don 't plan .
i won 't let you die .
no , i just don 't want anybody dying because i didn 't say something when i had the chance .
there was no card .
when i was ten , my family lived in pacifica for a year . i used to go to the beach everyday that summer . i never felt so happy , carefree . it was a magic place for me ... that 's where my heaven will be .
you know what ... i remembered you were here and i woke up .
never have children . if they 're not a burden to you , they 're a burden to someone else .
no . no ... i won 't be here for a while . the store will be closed in the interim .
tomorrow .
saluting .
did you tell him everything you wanted to ? did you do everything you could while he was here ?
good morning .
you should . children are a blessing from god . i have four .
he 's getting my sweater from the car . i said there was a breeze . i told him not to go .
what ? who are you ?
not really . my room 's not far . the whole year inn . you can drive with me if you want ...
no -- s.e.r.a .
why should i ? i know you 're not a cop , so what is it tonight ? another two-fifty to watch you sleep ?
i was looking for you tonight . i don 't know if you have a boyfriend ...
i think you should wear one at a time . one of these ... and one of your others . in fact , i was going to buy just one , but i didn 't think it would fly ... as a gift , i mean .
yes ... i guess i knew that .
oh , ben ... you look so very sick ... my love ... you 're so pale .
i am lonely , yuri .
it was a slow night . i went to a hotel for a few drinks .
what do you think ... you are sixteen years old on hollywood boulevard ?
it 's me , yuri .
yes . but i can 't tell you what it is .
i promised her i 'd keep it secret . i can 't break the bonds of sisterhood !
he 's gay -- he isn 't brooke 's lover ! he 's making it up . whoever killed heyworth is paying him off .
i 'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it . that 's what makes a good lawyer . and on top of that , you gained the client 's trust and kept it . that 's what makes a great lawyer . you 're smart , elle . smarter than most of the guys i have on my payroll .
spill .
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights , but she 's not completely unfortunate-looking .
trust me . you 've got the equipment , you just need to read the manual .
what 's the point of staying ? all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs . no one 's ever going to take me seriously . the people at law school don 't , warner doesn 't -- i don 't even think my parents take me seriously . they wanted me to grow up and become a victoria 's secret model who marries a rock star . now , for the first time , it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living . but i was kidding myself -- donovan didn 't see me as a lawyer . he saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else . it turns out , i am a joke .
you know her ?
oh , god , was this like an rsvp thing ?
although mr. huntington makes an excellent point , i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life ?
speak up in donovan 's class . he likes people with an opinion . sit in the back for royalton . he tends to spit when he talks about products liability .
thanks again for your help !

and engraved ... gives it that extra little something , doesn 't it ? see you tomorrow !
so are you !

thank you .
see ?
how was i supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on ?
i 'm covered in very expensive egyptian mud -- hardly naked .
it 's not a theta --
i mean , i know you 're upset and all , but can 't you just take a sedative ?
pull up next to him !
faith .
precisely . faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant .
i doubt the faeries will admire their beauty ... come , this will be fun to watch .
indeed , the best of fun ... enjoy yourselves .
we 're both of us damned , my beauty .
indeed i am , my dear ... that makes us a pair !
no false modesty , lad . you 're a proper champion . achilles ' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit .
something 's coming .
it would appear so .
careful , lad .
pure gold it is ... plays a different note every time .
gump , you 're putting words in my mouth .
there 's the way , mates .
nay . this time we strike first !
no ... but what choice have we ?
that 's it !
these chaps 'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth .
three cheers for our champion .
they 've fired the moat !
rise , screwball , and into the basket with you .
they 'll do nicely .
if you like .
to fetch your napkin .
jack ... forgive me ...
only what 's right ...
his feet shall never cross my lips .
another hero 's hand-me-down ... thurgis , note the armor ; tis greek work .
i pray god grants it me .
i know where to find him ... he lies out on the marsh , raven-fodder ; his horn torn from his head .
we wait .
i think she 's about to foal .
small miracles better than no miracles ...
done like a champion . can you reach me with the line ?
it 's done ... we 'll never catch him .
he was there and then he wasn 't !
home after . will you come in and say `` hi '' ?
who are you ?
what 's wrong ?
has he eaten anything at all ?
nope .
monday .
what 's that ?
maybe your tongue ... i don 't know , my mouth is numb . why did you do that ?
let 's shut up and not kill her .
i 've been dreading you .
months .
i want you both to stay .
i almost saw catalina .
goodnight .
no you don 't .
hey ... hey !
hi , mom .
yes .

he doesn 't answer .

he don 't sound like he 's from 'round here .
the fork is the least of your worries , claude .
i 'm not gon na let it go . the man needs to explain himself . makin ' promises .
well , not yet . it 's still in the planning stages .
just because it 's in my mind , goldmouth , don 't mean it ain 't real . everything worth anything starts with a dream .
he 's a good friend of mine . drops by the club whenever he 's in town .
i 'm afraid i 'm gon na have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners .
anybody else need anything read ?
comes up the mississippi . i can get more . a lot more . i was thinking about going into business for myself , but under the circumstances , i 'd be willing to take on a partner .

he superimposed your head onto `` scarface . ''
yes , jimmy .
the important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil . and i don 't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet . you need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time .
oh , would you grow up .
mr. sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side .

well ... you can 't have them all .
i 'm in my party mood .

it 's brighter there ... besides , we can 't go back .
sooner or later , we 'll have to try something .
the lifeclocks have no power outside .
beloved wife ...

thanks , guys .
i don 't know . maybe a hotel .
all right !
no ... thank you ! ... i 'll be bringin ' the `` caddy '' by tomorrow .
great question ! ! in the east ... the far east ... when a person is sentenced to death ... they 're sent to a place where they can 't escape ... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head ... it could be days ... weeks ... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced ... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation , don 't you think ? it 's been a pleasure talking to you .
sure . sure i do .
fuck you ! ! fuck you ! !
it 's always been a source of deep regret , but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible .
yes .

yes , of course . certainly . come on !
the bloke up there looks a chinese , or a mongolian , or something .

oh yeah ? the hell you weren 't . little pither just out of school ...
it 's an edna named after zed 's ex wife . all you do is at the target . the scope matches the image with the image on your retina . the barrel will find the target on its own .
history 's proven that where there 's a nitrogenizer , there 's a 12-legged signazoid . they use it to make our food digestible for their systems .

no . i don 't think you do . the other day , when he came to the cottage , he talked about a lot of things , but danny witwer , the man he was supposed to have just killed ? he didn 't mention him . he didn 't say his name even once .
my god ...
i padded your expense account for the last six months .
not quite .
you `` friend 's '' a murderer and he ruined our perfect record . six years , not one damn murder ...
i 'll reschedule . i 've been working too much anyway .

when you go busting your fists against a stone wall , you 're not using your brains . cause that 's what the white man wants you to do . look at you .
but the key to islam is submission . that is why twice daily we turn to mecca , to the holy of holies , to pray . we bend our knees in submission .
brother benjamin , do not rush , it has to be exact .
and now , without further remarks , i present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
that you haven 't time for either marriage or eating --
so it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat . the meat itself is foul .
you have to sleep for three .
malcolm , where are you ? we 've been calling all over the city .
thank you . now the negro in the field caught hell all day long . he was beaten by the master ; he lived in a shack , wore castoff clothes and hated his master . if the house caught fire , he 'd pray for a wind . if the master got sick , he 'd pray that he 'd die . and if you said to him , `` let 's go , let 's separate '' , he 'd yell , `` yeah , man , any place is better than this . '' you 've got a lot of field negroes in america today . i 'm one .
if she got eyes , she do .

lisa martin ramos , mr. creasy .
[ he 's the man , 'the boss ? ' my guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots . we had to inject the whole barrio . we bugged the house and stole the picture of him . ]
i think anything you want to do , you 'll do well .

a dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off . a berretta nine millimeter in his belt . a female hostage , red dress , on the floor in front of the cereal display . male hostage , jeans and blue checked shirt , three feet to her right . another male hostage , white pants , green shirt , nikes , laying in front of the magazine rack . a female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt , sitting against the beer cooler , trying to pass herself off as a hostage , and there 's a special on toilet-paper , four for a buck twenty-nine .
because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better ... we had a plan , but swat opened up too early . he got caught in the crossfire . let 's move on ... notice this . always use the eyes to keep the connection . it almost like hypnosis . that 's the most important thing . create a connection . you 're always on their side ...

he 's the boss of all the bosses , and i respect him .
come on . be polite .
fuck 'em .
yeah . but he needs me alive .
i don 't know . i guess it was ...
ohhh , nothing .
my daughter lives right across the street from the satan 's disciples ' clubhouse , and i was so worried about her ... so , i went over and introduced myself . and they were the nicest people .
listen -- the simpleton of all time -- a big-eyed patriot -- knows washington and lincoln by heart -- stood at attention in the governor 's presence -- collects stray boys and cats --
he 's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents . look at these congratulations pouring in ! i tell you , gentlemen , by this one statesman-like act , i have --
emma !
well , it sort of got to be -- from jeff just pullin ' splinters and things --
to -- to a reception -- uh -- for a princess -- i forget her name --
i will not yield , sir ! this same man -- mister taylor -- came here to offer me a place in this senate for twenty years , if i would vote for a dam that he knew and *i* knew was a *fraud* ! but if i opened my mouth against it , he promised to break me in two ! and i stood here one day and tried -- i *started* to open my mouth -- and it all came to pass . the long , powerful arm of mister james taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck --
j-jefferson smith .
i wouldn 't know in the *day time* .
i want to make that come to life -- yes , and lighted up like that , too -- for every boy in the land . boys forget what their country means -- just reading `` land of the free '' in history books . and they get to be men -- and forget even more . liberty is too precious to get buried in books , miss saunders . men ought to hold it up in front of them -- every day of their lives and say : `` i am free -- to think -- to speak . my ancestors couldn 't . i can . my children will . ''
mr. president -- i stand guilty as *framed* ! because section forty is graft , and i was ready to say so . i was ready to tell you that one man in my state -- mister james taylor -- was putting that dam through for his own profit !
order ! will senator smith yield to -- ?
it was *i* who rose in this chamber to accuse him . he is saying that i was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence --
morning , neighbors . morning .
sometimes twice .
oh yes , pixilated .
yes , indeedy .
he sure is .
your honor , what she is saying has no bearing on the case . i object .
oh , did i ? i 'm sorry . . .
yeah . anyway , there aren 't any photographers around .
oh , hello darling .
hurry up !
me , sir ?
this is outrageous !
suppose you just answer , miss jane . now , will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of longfellow deeds ?
what was that you said he was ?
proceed .
are you sure this is the town he lives in ?
yes . you see , rich people need someone to keep the crowds away . the world 's full of pests . then there 's the newspapers to handle . one must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it .
no , thank you .
no , thanks .
but you charge . i mean , you sell tickets ?
let me alone ! if you know what 's good for you - you 'll let me get this off my chest ! how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse ? get a kick out of it , huh ? got a big laugh ? did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings ! no !
yes . your uncle 's common-law wife . she has a legal claim on the estate .
yeah , what if i am ? what about it ?
an o-filler . you fill in all the spaces in the o 's , with your pencil . i was watching you .
fun ? say , listen , i 'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever . boy ! boy ! my headpiece !
i don 't know .
excuse me . what did you say ?
hmm ?
you never got back to me . ... i called to say we 'd like to take you out for a meal ? ... kind of a professional welcome .
now we 're back on track .
you are so mean .
i 'm not at liberty to say . sometimes it 's just routine , sometimes there 's been a complaint . we 'll be in touch .
... so accomplished .
insane ! didn 't ja hear ? my family got five hundred times better . let 's go , vanessa .
take a hike , dr. quack !
uh-huh .
you 're not the only one ...
harder than i thought . took me three tries . but i was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along . after two bomb-outs , i found a place in the desert ...
i don 't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport .
i don 't have one really . most of the time i 'm faking it . see , i think there 's not much that can be done about most problems ... they 're too complicated , too deep-rooted by the time i hear about them . the most i can do , usually , is look and listen real closely , try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody 's got . if i can get a sense of that , well then , maybe ... just maybe , i can help them out a little .
just looking for you , o'connell ! i wanted to be with my friend !
what friend ? you 're my only friend .
all i remember is him turning into a blast of sand , ... and then i remember nothing .
water turning to blood .
what did you do to him ! ?
to be hanged .
i am an english woman .

wait ! ... look !
are you serious ? this is the break we 've been waiting for !
no one 's sure that he actually exists , but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by the bus station .
who are we kidding ? no one 's gon na show . we 're living in a fantasy !

there are countless people in this world who believe they 're happy .
i understand your concern , but i feel it 's time you started thinking of yourself . look at yourself .
i can 't wait to begin on him . really , bert , i don 't know what we 'd do without you !
what does he know about it ?
no .
the wallet ! he took derek 's wallet !
just seeing how you 're doing . and , um , mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again , and we 're wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans , or should he be at one of the singles tables ?
tight as a nun 's asshole but qood concentration . nice fruit .
i 'm good .
you should get back together with victoria . she was good for you .
couple of wrong turns . thanks to magellan , here .
you said you loved me ! you fuck ! i hope you die !
that 's on us .
now we 're talking .
i don 't know . wine ? fermented grapes ?
want some ?
just a minute !
pour us a couple .
you have the keys .
i don 't know . casual but nice . they think you 're a writer .
i 'm fine !
lucked out -- got voice mail . everything 's cool .
um ... not exactly . but i 've been honest . i haven 't told her i 'm available . and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days . besides ...
you 're an asshole .
i don 't know . got it from stephanie .
quite a week .
nothing . buckle up , okay ?
back at you .
sure .
that 's what i 'm having .
fine . just slipped . this is my blood .
yeah .
a little place in los olivos . new owners . cozy ambiance . excellent food too -- you should try it . thought of you at the hitching post last night .
quaffable but far from transcendent .
we were thinking . why don 't we go back to my place ? i 've got wine , some insane cheeses , music , whatever .
she has a richebourg ? mon dieu . i have completely underestimated stephanie .
he had to make a phone call .
you fucking bastard ! lying piece of shit ! you 're getting married on saturday ? what was all that shit you said to me ?
please tie up isabelle to the back of the shed . make sure the knot 's tight .
i saw a monster . can i have a glass of water ?
why do you talk to mom when you 're by yourself ?
you don 't even know what that word means .
that 's weird .
me too .
hi baby .
boy , why aren 't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of t and a ?
i heard .
yes it was .
yes , it was .
i don 't want any one of you spending time with tracey abernathy alone . is that understood ?
it 's broken morgan . it 'll just keep doing this . let 's get out of the car okay ?
i got him .
ray reddy 's house .
good choice ... i 'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon . extra bacon .
while they were trying to fix her up , all she kept asking about was you .
from what ?
it came on about two hours ago . woke me up . we won graham .
graham .
we can 't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this .
don 't do it .
we 'll keep her in the garage , after dinner .
don 't yell at her !
you 're scaring your sister .
i hope they 're doing better than we are . we don 't even have helmets .
yeah baby . i think someone did .
what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it ?
no .
yes ... that 's the first thing colleen asked too .
yeah .
you 'll lose the signal !
there 's nobody coming ?
wait a minute . get down off of there , augie .
sure .
someplace safe . how you feeling ?
right .
not for five years .
which way do you mean ?
oh , i was just checking the , ah ... ... you know , lookin ' in .
last one to the midnight star buys .
tomorrow we 're going to town to straighten that out once and for all . the next day we 'll be back here ... farming . and these cattle better be gone .
he 'll be here .
let 's get out of here .
we 're going to make some adjustments . i wanted you to be here when i offered paden your job . i think he could do it without getting greedy . stella and i are tired of you skimming our profits .
shut up . you need help , don 't you ?
hello , paden . how ya doing ?
i run the place . what can i get you ?
give me some of the good stuff .
he left me .
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate ...
it was a great show , dad ...
hello , sweetheart .
hello , lainey .
night , lainey .
i love you too , daddy .
looks familiar , doesn 't she ? no one comes from nowhere , taransky . you turn over enough rocks ...
i certainly am , mr. taransky .
buy it ? they 're paying for it . and around here that 's how you really know they buy it .
-- do i know you ?
what ? you don 't see enough of me at the store ?
what , anna ? what did i do ? what 's made you so sad ?
i didn 't leave you .
goodnight , sweetheart .
no , just one .
you hate him ?
your eyes told me .
will you stay here till i fall asleep ?
don 't give up . you 're the only one who can help me . i know it .
oh .
yes .
standing next to my window .
they used to hang people here .
you talked funny when you went to school here . you talked funny all the way to high school !
stop looking at me .
who !
i wish i could be like my momma though . she always knew what was wrong . knew just what to say .
not lately .
the hell with this . i 'm coming back up ! ! !
suzie , face it . the only `` axe '' he 's picked up since we came here ... is a real one . he doesn 't give a damn about the band anymore ... or about you .
shotgun . suicide . next ?
sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it .
come out , come out wherever you are !
i don 't think so .
not while you 're driving .
ray -- i 'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn .
nah . just you .
you never had trouble communicating before .
i hurt my leg . diving away from the harvester -- it almost got me .
no . not without you --
spider .
who knows ? just like a man ... never around when you need them .
why bother ?
just checking out the lights .
new ? no . we 're hoping we find grant , he 'll lead us to her .
bill , i 'll run out to your car , call for paramedics from there .
we 're coming your way , man !
your momma wasn 't too proud when you came out neither , wally .
shit . you 're kidding me . nope . brenda brenda ! grant hell , you were --
grant ? why are there -- did you put locks on the garage ?
you 're pretty .
it 's just one of my students , grant .
we ain 't never gon na find that girl now .
'praise jesus ? ' that 's fucking pushing it , margaret .
what do you think ?
kate mcconnell . sweet , shy ... well- dressed . i 'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole .
okay .
trucker coffee . it 's three times stronger . good for a hundred miles . that , a coupla perks , and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound .
ciao .
you want to lose this putz or not ? ! ?
nice meeting you , cledus . keep on truckin ' .
well , that 's what you get for falling in love with a guy who 's first name is ramblin ' .
weight station .
maybe six months with good behavior . one to five .
promise me you won 't fall in love with an inmate .
that man is your father ? ! ?
you got ta admire the man 's determination .
see ya , kate .
because i need your help , sweet thing . and i need it bad .
that 's me .
pull your hammer back , smokey 's coming at you .
okay , we got a straight shot to t town , so let her roll .
redneck heaven .
they 're jammed !
forty-two minutes ahead .
it 's gon na be close . real close .
you 're about to hit a convoy . tighten up your rubber band . the oncoming 's clear .
about one to five years worth .
who 's fred ?
chickenshit money .
congratulations . you just became a legend maker .
the teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn 't sit too well with the local syndicate . night of the polling , big black-tie to-do downtown and the tremor brothers crash the party . literally .
i got his machine .
look at the collar on that coat ...
cinnamon roll ? no , good guess though . no , hugo that looks like jizz ... and i 'm no forensic expert mind you , but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf 's skin jacket . the twist ? it 's my twelve thousand dollar , calf 's skin jacket . so y'got semen , human ejaculate -- -- that 's been allowed to soak in for what , six , seven hours now ? work it 's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a tide commercial , i think it still safely qualifies as a `` tough , deep down stain . ''
... see , this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest ... and if i 'm asking you what you said to mecklen , assume the shit is rhetorical ... so assume i already know .
get in here goddammit !
... he does now ...
... almost . what do you mean `` who sparazza actually was ... ''
not you . some assholes on the elevator ... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what ? why the fuck they call 'm `` working girls . ''
security 's locking down the elevators .
jus ' keep doin ' y'damage girl , keep these mafuckas off my as --
not her . it .
kelvin , she begged me . i had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype , a miniature with a range of a few meters . she walked into it and disappeared . she was gone .
that 's right . and we all have to sleep , eventually .
she drank liquid oxygen .
yes .
i been thinking about how much i hate you .
that i am not rheya . that rheya died . killed herself . i 'm different .
a sleeping pill . do you want yours ?
i don 't know . something . anything .
shhhh . just stay with me . stay with me . everything is forgiven . everything .
gibarian was helpless . it 's very simple : man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris , and the ship that brought us here .
hard to find doors in this place .
he thinks you 're being a little careless . he made the point several times .
no , ma'am .
sleep good .
i don 't know . garber 's left orders here not to let you in the building .
i know .
... don 't explain .
it 's venza . he wants you . you , for ellie and tommy .
yeah . it 's all over .
you take care .
i 'm all right .
not great . i 've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide .
'til they pick up the perp . seniority gets day shift ... you know what that means .
let 'em eat their hearts out .
call a cruiser !
bad fuckin ' news . even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands . but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried . it 'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in .
be happy . he 's good at this .
it was my fault , t.j. fuck !
i 'll prove it !
i 'll take his place , all right ? put the gun to my head .
what the fuck you doin ' ? !
yeah , i think so .
oh , beware of jealousy , my lord , the green-eyed monster ...
be nice .
come on , laughter 's the best medicine !
get away from me , freak !
gim me that . pick it up later .
just about . see , i also have this amazing strength .
yeah . really gets to you if you let it .
it 'll shut itself off .
tofu . ben , i wish you wouldn 't .
see ? you big dullard .
truth . pure , eternal . beyond the boundaries of mere mortality .
hi , professor . what 's up ?
no , thank you . i 'm sure you 've got your own problems .
no , no ! not there !
plenty .
static !
how come the krauts knew about that stove , security ? and the tunnel ? how come you can 't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it ?
thanks .
you betcha . i said one of us is a stoolie . a dirty , stinkin ' stoolie !
let 's !
maybe they were layin ' for 'em out there !
where 'd that come from ?
blind ? how stupid can you get , animal ? i drank the stuff myself .
do jimmy durante !
hey , here 's esther williams .
i 'll open mine , too .
this is me , animal ! it 's harry shapiro !
yes , sir .
answer the question . how do you rate all those privileges ?
we 'll take care of schulz . come on .
go on , sefton -- butt out !
sure i heard it . i still got one good ear .
he 's a nazi , price is . for all i know , his name is preismaier or preissinger . sure , he lived in cleveland , but when the war broke out he came back to the fatherland like a good little bundist . he spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school , gave him phony dogtags --
you betcha . there ought to be some reward money from mama . say ten thousand bucks worth .
the one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket .
look at them , lieutenant . everybody is a clown ! how do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns ?
a chicken ?
okay , herr preismaier , let 's have the mail box .
where is he ?
i don 't know . he bathed , now he is roaming the ship . he must be the only engineer in starfleet who does not go to engineering !
full disruptors .
can you project its course ?
i have to find a way to get to soran .
i 'll go . you have the bridge .
oh yes . i remember everyone who was on the lakul , every face . even the ones who didn 't make it .
captain , i don 't know how much longer i can hold her together !
yes , yes , captain . thank you for coming .
you see the top yardarm , now look to the-
i can 't get an answer . starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference . no one has time for those who only stand ... and wait .
yes . he has a long journey ahead .
bones ... can you give me a quadrant bi-scan ?
dr. marcus , it 's your planet .
what is it ?
david --
spock 's burial robe .
grissom , your message acknowledged . will advise ... out .
he gave his life to save us . that is all i know .
goodbye , david .
much is at stake ...
full impulse power !
aye , sir , warp speed ...
yes , sir . it 's getting larger as we close in .
my friends , the great experiment : excelsior , ready for trial runs ...
welcome home , jim .
great power ... to control ... dominate ... destroy . if it works .
but sir ! federation starship approaching .
i trust my instincts . admiral kirk . this is your opponent speaking .
steady . continue on impulse power .

wait ! ... wait ...

ah .
we each face death every day we 're alive , saavik .
we have received new orders . upon our arrival at regula i , all materials of project genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at ceti alpha vi .
this is just to give us something to do , isn 't it ? come on .
never mind ! hurry !
you realize , sir , that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order .
i 'm doctor marcus !
we appear to have plenty of time .
visual --
here it comes . now , spock .
i 'm going down to the station .
scotty , let 's have it .
sensors , captain ?
midshipman first class peter preston , engineers mate , sir .
yes .
really , dr. mccoy ; you can not ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn . logic suggests --
chekov 's on reliant , isn 't he ?
it 's all we 've got .
prayer , mr. saavik . the klingons do not take prisoners . captain .
hurry .
phasers on stun . move out .
they just don 't want us going in there .
stop engines .
trying , sir !
battle stations .
best guess , mr. sulu . fire when ready .
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission ...
aft thrusters , sir .
ready , sir .
no power to the weapons system , sir .
i exaggerated .
just a couple of kooks ...
no way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him !
captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source .
tearing of the middle meningeal artery ...
that 's crazy ! who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale ?
yes , under `` u.s . government . '' now we need directions .
depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor .
sir , heat shields at maximum !
dr. mccoy , you , mr. scott and commander sulu will convert us a whale tank .
communicate ? communicate what ? you have no right to be here !
i was not .
to put it mildly . since the dawn of time , men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes , most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point . a hundred years ago , using hand-thrown harpoons , they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they 've achieved in this century .
you need me .
to the on-board computer room . to confirm my suspicion .
he meant what you were saying on the tour : that if things keep on the way they 're going , humpbacks will disappear forever .
no data , admiral . computers are non-functional .
steady as she goes ...
we 'll divide into teams . commanders chekov and uhura are assigned to the uranium problem .
go , mr. sulu .
hover on my mark , mr. sulu ! mr. chekov , stand by de-cloaking -- scotty , ready for power build up ! mark , mr. sulu ...
capability , yes . but where can warp drive take us , except away from here ... ?
to move you off this planet . you go to sleep one night in your village ... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse . a week later , maybe a month , you 've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it .
i 've been shot at ... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that 's come to abduct us all ... what 's there to panic about ?
your captain used to cut quite a rug ...
yes . but look at this medscan ...
what you 're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields ...
another forty-three people reported taken , sir ...
it 's nothing . i 'm just tired .
deck ten .
commander riker ...
you klingons never do anything small , do you ...
evasive maneuvers ... heading one- four-zero mark three-one ...
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up ?
activating injector assembly .
montana ? well , that answers everything . why the hell are we --
i 've stabilized him for now ... but he 's in a coma and he 's going to need radiometric therapy . i want to take him to the ship .
it was an experience . metal scalpels ... needle and thread ...
bring us about . target borg ship alpha four , port side battery .
where 's the sphere ?
according to our astrometric readings ... the year is 2063 .
not very well . we met shortly after the enterprise-e was commissioned . i found her to be a most ... promising officer .
picard to enterprise . picard to enterprise -- do you read me ?
wrong answer , mister picard . try again .
on screen .
population ... thirty-five billion ... all borg .
we have to follow them back ... repair whatever damage they 've done to that time-line .
western hemisphere ... north american continent ...
fire .
fire !
i 'll keep in contact . you have the bridge .
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish .
where the hell are they going ?
something is very wrong , commander . we 're falling back .
data 's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise . command codes , security protocols ...
i 'm going too . they may need a doctor .
that 's the question -
you heard the order , lieutenant .
she didn 't need our help getting anywhere ... where did she get these convenient clothes ? and don 't tell me that flare is standard prison issue ...
come on ...
starfleet 's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of `` exploration '' ...
captain , shall we attempt to return fire ?
that 's a comfort ...
how can i trust --
captain sulu ... on assignment ... anyone seen spock ?
uhura , monitor !
who else ?
she 's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that .
shields up . battle stations .
second star to the right - and straight on till morning ...
shields up , captain -- ?
mr. valtane , any more data ?
they 'll be here ...
there 's a reward for your death .
who else ... ?
captain .
uhura , signal our surrender .
you hear that ?
the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal .
we 've fired on the chancellor 's ship -
according to the data bank , we have - twice ...
not yet ... section 4236 ...
probably trying to figure out why we 're reversing , wondering if we detect her .
this is the starship enterprise , captain james kirk commanding .
who else ?
in the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight . according to our data banks , this ship fired those torpedoes .
such things have happened before , sir .
an error .
confirmed , captain !
mr. scott , you forget yourself . please accompany me .
no .
you 're working late .
i can 't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating .
to happy endings .
i can see that .
it would appear so .
full axis rotation to port ! fire all ventral phasers !
deanna , stand by . open a channel .

the resemblance is ... striking .
thank you .
with pleasure , captain .
i know how he thinks .
deanna troi of betazed . empathic and telepathic abilities , ship 's counselor . all of this i knew ... but i didn 't know you were so beautiful .
very logical , deanna ... but your heart doesn 't constrain itself to mere logic . to leave all of this behind and be with me .
then how did a reman get to be praetor ? i don 't get it .
he wants to look me in the eye .
on screen .
your new chair , sir .
away team . transporter room four .
we can only hope so .
age before rank , jean luc .
in time .
i need a sample of your blood . what do your borg friends say ? resistance is futile .
disruptors are off-line , sir .
should i raise shields ?
defensive pattern kirk epsilon . geordi , get those shields online .
let 's go .
yes , praetor .
a matter of hours now .
probably kids .
i 'm afraid we can 't let you go .
ah no .
what .
that way .
you 're full of tricks , aren 't you ?
i am ...
i know .
shit !
i was afraid .
but i have never seen this before . i am not complete .
no . i 'm just not tired . let 's go .
i gave you a baby last night .
you say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye . '
hey , she doesn 't want to go with you . come on .
get fox .
we 're ready .
we better get it into the box . come on ...
parlez vous francais ? ... habla ingles ? ... sprechen zie deutsch ?
too bad about your guy jeriko . tough break .
yup . so darn lucky . i wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan , and a cop pension i can 't live off of . good thing i wasn 't any luckier . bobby ! another shooter right here !
that would be between me and faith , wouldn 't it ?
go to the sunset sheraton . right now ! just go ! go !
wants to share .
yeah . i 'm ghosting pretty bad .
ok . he asks about you all the time . it 's been weeks since you 've seen him .
jesus , mace !
anywhere . we 'll talk about it in the car .
this tie doesn 't go with blue !
the gas tank 's going to go any second !
deputy commissioner palmer strickland . the sanctimonious prick who busted me out . his ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it . i know this guy . if there 's one cop who 's not dirty it 's him .
no . they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake .
uh unh .
naw . they just have to ask us a few questions ... for about six hours .
fucking . i 'm talking about fucking , harold . you ever think of fucking other women ?
take a look , harold . tell me if you see anything you want . you do like to look , don 't you ?
it 's been wiped down a hundred times since then .
thank you , rangers . put this man in the unmarked .
suspect zero , now there 's an idea that doesn 't look good on paper --
it explains a lot .
could be a lot of things . depends on the freezer . i 'm sorry , mack , but i don 't think this is the answer .
i 'm going to amarillo .
sit back .
i 'll give you a little hint . you 're a smart guy , figure it out .
yeah .
whatever happened to mydick ?
he wants us to know he 's out there , what he 's doing . it 's not enough just to kill somebody like speck , he wants us to know he did it .
shuddup .
what else is going on ?
did you get it ?
i 'm a comedian .
yes , but i 'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet . perhaps you 'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables .
classy .
no problem , buddy . you eat anything today ?
hey sue . gretsky 's on his ass again .
give me the money . i 'll get it .
he 's trying to be an actor .
she didn 't like me ... i made a fool of myself ...
vegas !
well ... we 're not in kansas anymore .
aww ... he got away ?
don 't sweat it , baby . this one 's a lay-up .
yeah . i guess you could call it that .
what an asshole . didn 't you see `` boys in the hood '' ? now one of us is gon na get shot .
chelios to roenick ... !
that 's so bullshit . this is so bullshit .
... how novel .
damn . now i got ta go in early .
what 'd you want me to do ? back down ? he called me a bitch . we kept our rep .
... whatever . things are different here . it 's not like new york , mikey .
... it 's on .
... it 's definitely on .
... it is so on .
your girl friend . she says she can 't make it tonight . you lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number . i 'll kill you , you bastard !
you won 't see paulie anymore . he 's sick for good this winter .
drive while you thinking ; i wan na get to the city this month !
ok , go to arthur avenue ; i 'm suppose to call when i found somethin ' .
you understand him better than anyone .
it 's from johnny . it was announced this morning . he 's going to play the lead in the new woltz brothers film .
shhhhh .
come here a minute , fredo .
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time . what about the hit list .
no . our informer in mccluskey 's precinct . tonight at 8:00 he signed out for louis ' restaurant in the bronx . anyone know it .
let 's say now that we have to kill mccluskey . we 'll clear that up through our newspaper contacts later .
let me think about it , o.k . ?
they want me to go to the conference with sollozzo . set up the meeting for two days from now . sonny , get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held . insist it has to be a public place : a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour . so i 'll feel safe . they 'll check me when i meet them so i won 't be able to carry a weapon ; but clemenza , figure out a way to have one planted there for me . then i 'll kill them both .
is it all right if i go to the bathroom ?
the hotel , the casino . the corleone family wants to buy you out .
hell , he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time . players couldn 't get a drink .
what are you doing in mongi ?
meet my father , herbert richard greenleaf 1st .
it 's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- freddie , fausto , peter smith-kingsley -- he 's wonderful -- did you meet him , he 's a musician ? -- ... and especially you , of course ... and that 's only the boys .
mr ripley ? i 'm alvin maccarron .
bird . that 's jazz .
sure .
i think you 're right .
to the manner born .
i think we sort of found each other .
he 's not coming till the morning . evidently his stomach -- i don 't think the food here is agreeing with him .
no , nothing . i 'm just thinking about when tom arrived in mongi . and now look at you .
i don 't know how to translate that . e difficile ... il signor ripley ... dormiva all'aperto , con un ...
he says so many fiances .
i 'll fix some drinks .
hello , betsy .
and the kid says , `` yeah . she 's about 19 , good-lookin . '' mccall says , `` what can i tell you ? ''
yeah . hey thanks . that 's real nice , travis .
at least i don 't walk the streets like a skunk pussy . i don 't screw and fuck with killers and junkies .
what kind of guns do you guys use ? .38 's ?
some fleet driver for bell just got cut up . just heard it on the radio .
slow .
you want to talk about it ?
you know how i feel about what you do .
okay . how 'bout carla goodspeed ? six years , bill . we 've lived together six years .
archbishop of canterbury . imprisoned and executed by henry the second ...
my girlfriend 's pregnant .
what is happening ? where 's mason ?
for cottonmouth . goodspeed and the s.e.a.l.s exchange looks .
it 's all i could think of .
now they only have three rockets left .
it 's about time .
yes . to wish someone a prosperous jouey .
i am , too .
whatever happens .
i 've seen you before . your picture ...
you must not remember anything . come on .
no ... i can 't ... i have to ... i can 't ...
um ... no . i don 't have a statement at this time .
well , son , you 're home !

nine and-a-half years ...

thanks .
we live in a theater ?

because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today , mr. carter . it 's estimated that five billion , seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the united states alone . the five continents of the world ...
that 's right . we had a party here this afternoon for cathy . her birthday .
i know you can . but i 'd like to .
no , you got quite a mess here , i 'll admit that . maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney seems a little pointless , though . freak accident like this wouldn 't happen again in a million years . you want some help cleaning up ?
just some peroxide . i want to clean out the cut .
yes .
i 'll get it .
i ... i don 't think so . if we get through town , i think we 'll be all right .
oh , good ! oh , wonderful .
what ? oh , yes , certainly .
i thought not . birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx , miss daniels ; a hundred and twenty million years ago !
good morning , mr. fettes .

the cop who found the knife in corvis 's car .
i assure you such power exists .
hello , darling . good evening , mr. carpenter .
well , not exactly . i gave him two dollars .
no -- i 'm afraid not .
we went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see daddy --
jittery is the word .
before i ask you to be honest with me , perhaps i should be completely honest with you --
what time is it ?
you see -- the electricity 's been neutralized -- all over the world .
yes -- just exactly .
back to the boardinghouse . i 'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and i can keep an eye on bobby . he 's the only other person who knows anything about --
no , i 'm a resident as of today and you 'll probably be seeing a lot of me ... i 've been collecting comic books all my life ... perhaps you 'd like to see my collection ?
you got ta drive !
zero .
i 've only got one question for you , and i want an honest answer . have you taken any human victims yet ?
they 're gon na book us .
why ? they 're only noodles .
get your bike . we 're going someplace .
what 's goin ' on , marko ?
you 're one of us , now -- aren 't you ?
sorry , michael . no hard feelings , huh ? here . try these noodles .
his fingernails are longer , but he always has bad breath .
hit the lights again .
vampires , my friend . vampires .
your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em !
if you 're telling the truth , it means we can save you .
when i dressed like you do now , you threw me out of the house . i used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits ... then i went ahead and married one ... i went yuppie and you became a hippie ... were still out of synch .
lots more where he came from .
this is michael .
soon as i finish this comic . okay ?
he 's already gone to bed .
hi , thorn .
i know . it 's so 'eighties . ' it 's the cute decade .
ohm i would have been ... one marriage ago .
burn ? ? are you kidding ? it 's freezing !
yeah . i 'm not trying to replace your dad ... or steal your mom . i just want to be your friend .
wan na change my hair , my clothes , my face .
no . on the phone .
look at your reflection in the mirror ! !
the marines .
i ... i don 't feel any differently . do you ?
nowhere ... just straight to the ocean .
... you think this thing wants to become an animal ? dogs can 't make it 1000 miles to the sea . no skua gulls to imitate this time of year ... no penguins this far inland ... don 't you understand ? ! it wanted to become us !
now who 'd go and do ...
now hold on , you dumb ...
hell no .
no . the generator . you got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen . get to it . where 's the damn flashlight ? you fellas okay over there ?
childs , you got the torch ? you get your ass in here ! !
probably the next meal .
you 're a dead man , macready -- or a dead whatever the hell you are !
we 'll see . let 's try clark .
smart s.o.b . he put it together piece by piece .
what do you mean `` you think so ? ''
they 're not swedish , goddamn it , they 're norwegian , macre --
i think so .
started with six . there 'd be four others left .
what 's that ?
one thousand volts . should be enough .
little over two hours .
blair . he 's gone berserk .
i 'm sure a lot of you already know .
screw the flashlights . where the hell were you ?
couldn 't be possible . must have weighted a ton and a half ...
everything that 's been missing .
forget about childs . he 's over .
right . half of us awake at all times .
hear what ?
but there 's nothing here .
why should i help you ? you primates -- you great , lumbering , hairy animals , drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed ! a little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world ! you 're no better than the morlocks !
no ...
oh , you won 't be running for long ...
nothing -- let 's just get out of the park .
shhh . let 's just hurry on here . we don 't have to talk , all right ?
alex , it 's just the zoo .
let them .
i have something for you ...
good night , alex .
his home .
well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn 't really . it 's rather hard to explain .
mm .
just a dream . you should sleep too . you 're still not well .
good night .
orion 's belt ...
kalen -- we have to get kalen -- !
my laboratory was about ... here . and the kitchen was over there , where that tree is . mrs. watchit wouldn 't allow me in much ... but , yes , this is about the kitchen .
very good . now if you will excuse us for a moment .
we can 't change the day and the night , alexander . this is the world .
young man , we have a way of doing things here . radical theorizing is not acceptable . have i made myself understood ?
i am . are you a climber ?
oh yeah , sure . he killed a cop , right ?
how ?
i don 't know . [ beat ] i thought i was crazy after you left that day . i died . i still think i could be crazy . but then i replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it i could remember -- and it was like ... i don 't care if i was , or am . i haven 't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life . [ beat ] and when you left , all i wanted was ...
here , drink this . i 'll get the heat going .
yeah . i called the number yesterday to make sure . thomas becker , retired m.d .
to the hospital .
you 're bleeding pretty bad there .
i 'm doing fine .
i was working with a boy named eugene .

i 'm sorry , it 's just that you 're taking this all wrong , pal . don 't you see ? you 're liberated . i feel liberated . i mean here you 've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever , and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you !
i 'm usually too tired to be .
you stole her from me . now i want her back .
i 'm doing okay . i got ta get ready for work .
dumbshit .
here you go . what 's that smell ?
huh ... that 's strange .
hey , watch your mouth -- she 's a great gal . i 'm the dumbshit for lying to her .
you look great . hey , mare , do i have a rip in the back of these pants ?
oh , uh , i resigned .
fetched a pretty penny , too . don 't forget , it 's the sumo culture , they pay by the pound there . sort of like tuna .
surprised ?
you heard me , goddamnit . i ... i love her .
fucking sickening .
look , if it wasn 't you who sent the letter , and it wasn 't me who sent it ?
must have a sweet tooth . see if you can find some cookies .
kind of . ted peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world .
puffy , get over here .
tucker , you look different some how . did you do something with your hair ?
thanks , but i 've got to be going . unfortunately , doc , this isn 't a social visit .
well ... i 've got a little more news about your friend healy .
i 've got a friend in the boston police department . he faxed me this this morning . i 'll just give you the highlights . after a short stint as a petty thief , patrick r. healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen . at sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher 's aid named molly pettygrove . he was incarcerated until age twenty-two when , despite a grim psychological profile , the state was forced to release him . in his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington . unfortunately , the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn 't enough evidence to hold him , and on and on and so forth and so on .
thanks a lot , ted .
hi , mary .
just a minute .
oh yeah , that 'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn 't even drink beer or gamble .
teddy , be brave .
yeah , i 'll bet you all were . come on , in the truck .
i don 't mind . if you think he can hold me .
jesus , i think her brother spotted me .
huh ... ?
bye , ted .
then you 'll call , right ?
-- i 'm just trying to make a point . this idea is that fucking bad .
cuba .
time is of the essence .
48 hours . in 48 hours there can be no deals .
good .
oh , just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the soviets 'll do the same in cuba .
our police are afraid of them . please get them out of here .
leo 's been out here too long , man . i 'm taking him to ceremonial burial .
airborne . that 's where they used to get us agents from . now we get 'em from carnegie-melon , ivy league . accountants and computer whiz-kids . yuppies with guns . that 's scary shit .
that 's what it looks like , doesn 't it ? but that 's what a ten gauge , choke-bored , shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away .
check him out , ray .
good .
one of the leaders of the warriors of all red nations . militant organization .
she talks a lot of shit . we 're not doing our job . jimmy 's innocent . `` what 's the fbi really doing here . '' some shit about the fort laramie treaty .
yeah , alright , alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world . go get a tail on eagle bear , and stay with her . cuz jimmy 's gon na show . and i want you to make the collar .
watch out !
you 're steppin ' on sign .
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster . he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster .
the owl is a messenger . when one shows itself to a sioux ... it means someone 's gon na die . the owl told him about leo .
you want solid ? that one , single , print he left in the badlands -- the one the fbi missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first . like a white man . jimmy has a serious ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first . the man who murdered leo walked like a wasi'cu .
ain 't prayer flags , that 's for sure .
yeah . it 's time to beat the drum . you better wait here . he don 't trust the white man .
he hasn 't left this place in twenty years . they got him .
if you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little ... we 'll be here .
that 's right . turn around .
when you see jimmy , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in ... the sooner we back off this reservation . okay ?
ray . what 's your 20 ?
all i know ... is i did what i did ... and i ain 't in solitary , gettin ' pumped up with downer , gettin ' beat to shit . but i tell you what , suit . take me back . cuz i can 't take this shit no more .
it 's classified . like hollywood says , i could tell you , but then i 'd have to kill you .
you know . the finger .

they know the rules ... that 's the deal . that 's why you 're up there . it 's him or me . that 's the price of admission . it bothers you , why ? you 're part of it . everybody dies . most people don 't get to die for something .
thanks very much . care for some suchi ? .
that wasn 't fair . it was a question . penalty round !
your watch .
sir . you are going to give me a warning , sir !
everybody 's got to be somewhere . ..now we 're right with you . you are inverted . roll it , cougar .

goddamnit , mav , you really are a slow learner . don 't worry , fung , i 've got it .
oh , no . you did the flying , i 'll do the talking !
flaming hooker . sort of an institution around here . or maybe this is the institution , i forget which . it 's the house drink . it 'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it .
could use a dash more jet fuel .

what , been drunk ? sure ! plenty !
he should 've had me . goose take it down . let 's bug out of here . call for a draw .
look , ma , top of the world !
i wouldn 't call it victory . it 's more like ... self immolation .
don 't chew it , you won 't have it that long . easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks .
nothing . let 's just go fight .
it 's not the plaque . the winner can get assigned here as instructor . he gets to fight every day .

the last resort ! quick !
whatcha doin ' to me , man ? ! i got six kids to feed !
they 've got you bugged , and they 'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what i say .
it 's about goddamn time .
i 've been trying to tell you . someone erased his memory .
don 't you keep up with the news ? we 're doing alien artifacts now .
at rekall .
no need to be rude . i 'll do it .
it 's a symbol . of your desire to return to reality . -- inside your dream , you 'll fall asleep .

from the data - and from that picture the air force took earlier tonight ... ... what we 've got in the gully out there is a guide ship . one lands ... others follow later . they appear to clear an area , then drop in groups of threes , joined magnetically . is that possible ?
sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him . did he say anything while he was still lucid ?

james , fall semester , first day of class , it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat .
in a minute . get us a table .
nowhere . you just sit here and ... eat .
i think maybe we 're missing the point . it seems to me james ' strength as a writer is that he doesn 't take us by the hand . he treats us like adults . he respects us enough to forget us . that takes ... courage .
it beats 'what 's your major ? '
i 'm sorry . it 's these goddamned shoes . i don 't know how anyone actually walks in these things .
it 's -- it 's a souvenir . of baltimore .
caps .

this little table is one heavy bitch .
mariners are pounding the shit out of the tigers .

lovers ' quarrel ?

yeah ?
hi .
twelve years in prison is no joke .

how deep 's the drop-off here ?
missile compartment . those are the launch tubes .
hey , you okay ?
chill out , lindsey ! !
look , the guy 's operating on his own , cut off from chain of command . he 's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis . and he 's got a nuclear weapon . so , as a personal favor to me ... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while ?
it 's trying to communicate .
now what ?
yeah . so sue me .
deepcore , this is cab one . we need assistance , over . deepcore , this --

what kind of luminous things , bud ?
perry , stand by on the rov . sorry about this , little buddy . better you than me , know what i mean ?
it 's twitching but it 's below the line you said was safe .
i know how alone you feel ... alone in all that cold blackness ... but i 'm there in the dark with you , bud you 're not alone ...
he 's hallucinating badly .
through three miles of water ? i don 't know .
fine . can 't you see so yourself ?
that 's patrizia 's way of letting us know she 's with us .
but anna wouldn 't be staying with the kind of people who live here .
no .
but why don 't you tell him ? a girl who was with us has disappeared .
no , sandro , please ... i ask you as a favor ...
yes ... but it 's all so conflicting ... however , there is some slight indication ...
but then why did you bother changing ?
to the shark .
this is claudia , anna 's friend ... you 've never met my husband , have you ?
ask her .
yes , even i had a mother . she was part austrian , but she was still my mother . my childhood was like a tennis match ; they bounced me back and forth , here and there ...
lady patrizia !
what did she mean ?
yes .
what about roger ? he 's free .
i don 't believe this . i don 't bloody believe this .
about two years before .
how dare you think i 'm in a position to be pressured ...
... or bullied or what ever you 're doing . who the hell do you think you are ? you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child .
and she has a right to know that there 's a world out there filled with people who don 't believe in god ... ... and aren 't any worse off than you mother . people who 've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once , to anybody . and people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy . she has a right to know that . but you and your ... your order and your church have kept her ignorant ...
i 'd like yours too .
read 'em !
bag-snatcher .
ah well . eh , look !
he 's sulking again .
sorry .
follow your impulse .

i should hope so ! and we 'd better make sure it 's pretty far from the ship when we blow it .
you lead .
my signal 's fading .

can 't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything , fast .
i couldn 't make it out -- too much interference .

sandy , contact traffic control .

no -- that 's atmosphere . cloud layer .
turn on navigation lights .
engine room , what happened ?
sandy ... how far are we from the source of the transmission ?
he went into the pyramid alone . we lost radio contact with him . when we pulled him out , it was on his face . it won 't come off , not without injuring him .
broussard had film in his datastick , didn 't he ? we can see what happened to him .

we ran a trajectory simulation . if they carry on along that path , it 's possible they 'll make intra-orbital insertion .
match it !
nooooo !
alright , let 's keep calm . we 've got to have an option of some sort ... there 's got to be a way out of this .
that 's what i mean . this is the quietest i 've ever heard it . it 's unnatural .
i dunno .

-- he said john haldeman , not bob haldeman --
goddamnit ! --
that 's right .
-- goddamnit , when 's somebody gon na go on the record on this story --
if they ever start calling us goddamn liars -- -- it 's time to start circling the wagons .
-- right , right , i 've got to go . why did you lie just then ?
-- all non-denial denials -- we 're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don 't say the story is inaccurate .
my non-denial denial .
-- i 'm not sure , it still feels thin --
mitchell started the cover-up early , everyone is involved in the cover- up , all the way to the top . the whole u.s. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities . the extent of it is incredible . and people 's lives are in danger , maybe including ours .
hunt is colson 's man -- -- that 's charles colson , nixon 's special counsel -- -- they both went to brown university -- -- hunt worked for the c.i.a . till '70 , and this is on deep background , the fbi thinks he 's involved with the break-in .
-- well , sloan --
one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes .
according to white house personnel , hunt definitely works there as a consultant for colson . but when i called the white house press office , they said he hadn 't worked there for three months . then the p.r . guy said the weirdest thing to me . `` i am convinced that neither mr. colson nor anyone else at the white house had any knowledge of , or participation in , this deplorable incident at the democratic national committee . ''
-- can we use their names ? --
larry young , a california lawyer --
my wife told me to expect you . as you know , i haven 't talked to the press .
well , when liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds , i went to the safe and gave him -- out of this whole fortune -- i happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me -- banks have to keep track of hundreds . if the money had been in fifties , or if i 'd grabbed a different stack , there probably wouldn 't have been any watergate story .
a girl . melissa .

i hate that -- every time i hear that noise something terrible happens .
i don 't know .

kurtz . i 'm supposed to kill him , just like he said .
said i speak french like a spanish cow .
this whole area is lousy with v.c . -- we don 't stand a chance . lem me turn around and we 'll be in hau fat in six minutes .
in the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light .
we 're americans .
if they have boats ... or canoes ... they 'd get lost in the fog . we can 't move either -- we 'll end up on the shore .
too far inland .
anyone got a cigarette .
maybe it 's not kurtz . i don 't believe he 's capable of that . i just don 't believe it .
he was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war .
they must have seen the fire .
we took them from the dead . now -- i assume you want to rest , to shower . we 'll attend to your repairs after dinner .
sure -- fine --
what ?
yes .
no . my thinking is clear . but my soul has gone mad .
just something i read in the free press .
he can 't kill us . we 're on his side .
yeah , jesus christ !
no -- leave it --
the river is beautiful .
you may think what you wish , captain , but i like you very much .
then philippe will have to kill all of you .
anyone got a card ?
you can pack out of here -- two , three days ' hike along this river at most . weather should hold this early in the season .
needs patching .
now , why don 't you get around to saying what you want .
mind if i get some stuff from my kit ?
wait 'til i 'm across !
inside of three hours you 'd be dragging my dead carcass .
used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome .
so they can patch me up and put me in a cage ? forget it . meyerling 's right -- i 'm a dinosaur . greedy bastards like him , it 's their turn with this land . put me in the woods , let me live or die on my own .
43 continued :
i 'll get you there all right .
94 continued :
it 'll be interesting , trying to build a fire without any wood .
i just want this over with .
how ? nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season . besides , i 'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics .
there isn 't one , unless corbett 's men get here before the plane does .
i 'd sure like that favor you offered a while back .
your infrared camera ?
keep back .
i was making my rounds , saw your hangar wide open , plane getting rained on , so i closed it up .
question is why they sat here when the storm moved in . check their stuff while i sniff around .
28 continued :
back against the bars . now .
be right back . i left my camcorder in the car .
he still might be around . i saw fresh tire tracks coming in .
be careful -- there 're two of them .
wait a second .
that 's my line .
nothing broken . c'mon , we have to hurry .
-- killing is what you know . pack some food while i prep for the flight . i 'm sure not gon na let him go .
hunting and trapping was a damn fine life . me and mitchell , bob and lemalle , we were teams . i 'd always go with mitchell . good man , mitchell . i 'd let bob worry about goddamn lemalle . we 'd hire a plane in october . on the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere , we 'd drop supplies . we 'd land , tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before christmas .
you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger ?
i 'm right behind you .
cowardly bastard . i 'm in handcuffs and i still scare the piss out of you .
you kill me , you sign your death warrant . and hers .
but i would .
good idea . flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises . go too low , one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it .
just stay out of my face until i 'm gone !
aw , jesus . told you this was trouble . what about you , big shot ? do something . who 's side are you on , anyway ?
cool out . i ain 't about to get blasted .
ease off . we do this my way .
uh-huh .

good night .
i 'll take care of myself --
you think you 're kidding .
he 's a pain in the ass .
hi . you have hard shells , right ?
like thick molasses , with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food ...
maybe this can wait .
never a break . never .
i forgot to lock the door .
no . no . no . hey , that painting in there ... i just want to tell you ...
there 's a sand barricade up ahead ; i 'm going to ram this cab into it . the cab has an airbag , odds are good i 'll survive . but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass , odds for you are not so good .
bain !
you 're too late .
freelancer . a woman . surveillance specialist .
we have an m.o ... her system is protected by her 'pussy virus . '
where are we going ?
turn off the engine .
no , stay in the car . i want you to understand something . if i intended to kill you , you would already be dead .
he will know everything about you . everything . i know , because i 've done it . once you 've been inside a mark 's home , you 're in their head . if you 're any good , you 'll find the mark in a week , and bain is good because i was the best and i couldn 't take him .
he was killed .
yes .
yes . please come in .

but i love you !
and , since it 's only two streets away , i suggest we go take a look . now !
the way i look at it , i 've carried the camel to water and stuffed it 's head under - if it doesn 't drink now , we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day .
yeah , we 'd better keep them for now , i 'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night .
yeah seems okay .
first , i want to walk free with a letter , in english , from the prosecutor general dropping all charges . second , i want two first class tickets to london leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope . lastly , all actions against the students are to be stopped !
yes , you are free to go , karel here will drive you home .
leave me , just leave me alone josh .
heart be still .
i 'll tell her you were here .

she 's not . she 's got her own ideas .
what kind of a man are you , son ?
no . thanks . got ta keep my wits for the drive home .
'yes . you're-you 're b-b- beautiful . '
so you agree you need help ?
i do know . be two places at once ... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel ... eat breakfast with chopsticks ...
and you have to meet my father .
that is my telescope .
looking for something -- someone .
sometimes i don 't even trust me .
healthy as can be .
and that would ruin your reputation how ?
that sounds like horseshit .
yeah , with a finish in about a decade .
it means you can do anything .
fun .

maybe you 're not supposed to .
not possible .
the challenger exploded . principal kelly 's about to make an announcement .

how is that possible ? how could all that information be encoded in --
it 's a hoax . i knew it !
no , thanks .
it could be anything . the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica ...
analyzing signal polarization shifts .
i 'm not sure . you mind checking right ascension 18 hours , 34 minutes ; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes ?
japanese squid fleet . they use lights to attract them to the surface ... then turn them into sushi .

inspector halloran , homicide . i 'm in charge here .
look at the bottom of the screen . you see the icon with the arrow pointing left ? click on that ... twice .

tonight .
stick around and find out .
-- shut up ! don 't you try to make me feel bad about this . you knew what would happen to you if you didn 't pay . this is on your head , not mine . break his arm .
wait ! i 'm a friend !
what 's it to you ?
i have a guest .
i 'll write your name . just for fun .
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days ... it took me a while to get in here . i can 't wait any longer . i was wrong to let you go . come back with me . you 'll be happy in the desert . you 'll be free there .
you must decide . you might get tired of this life . you might begin to miss your family . if it were our daughter , we 'd look for her too . she would miss us . jen ... i want you to be mine forever . i will make my mark on the world . i will earn your parents ' respect . we have a legend . anyone who dares to jump from the mountain , god will grant his wish . long ago , a young man 's parents were ill , so he jumped . he didn 't die . he wasn 't even hurt . he floated away , far away , never to return . he knew his wish had come true . if you believe , it will happen . the elders say , `` a faithful heart makes wishes come true .

what 's the big deal ? we 're friends . haven 't you ever seen your friends naked before ?
not at all . have a seat .
you are very pretty . i would like to kiss you .
oh please annette . you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love . well here it is . right in front of you , but you 're going to turn your back on it . i 'm sorry that we 're not at the age where we can get married . if we were , i 'd propose , but that 's not going to happen . so i guess we 're just fucked . i 'll move on , but you ... you 're going to have to live with yourself knowing you 've turned your back on love . and that makes you a hypocrite .
get off me .
sure .
cecile , is that the best you can do ? you must forgive her , kathryn . she 's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before .
i was thanking her . vietnamese is such a beautiful language .
it 's kathryn .
i swear .
some other time , cecile .
honey , is something wrong ?
baby ? right on time .
likewise i 'm sure .
shhh .
cecile .
eat me , sebastian . it 's alright for you to fuck everyone , but because i 'm a girl it 's wrong . well let me tell you something , i didn 't ask to be a girl . do you think i relish the fact that i have to act like mary sunshine twenty four seven , so i can be considered a `` laaaady . '' do you think i take great delight when i hear - `` kathryn is so wonderful . '' `` kathryn is a model child . '' `` kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day . '' i 'm the marsha fucking brady of the upper east side and sometimes i want to kill myself for it . no , i don 't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer . so there 's your psychoanalysis doctor freud . now are you in or are you out ?
thank you . now , where were we ?
you bastard !
hello . i just met amy and she pointed out where you live .
you know what i wished , daddy ? i wished i could be a good girl .
i thought amy was calling . i guess not .
amy picked it off the top of that stack . perhaps you 'd better go through the whole bunch . there may be others of irena in there .
that darn kid . i never in my life expected her to get an a in arithmetic . math 's is a practical science -- - if she understands figures , she 's well out of her own world of make-believe .
and you should . your mommy tells me you 've been such a good girl , and your daddy is so pleased with you .
voices from an old dark house !
this one says , `` to mother from amy . ''
a merry christmas to you , amy .
don 't you read shakespeare ?
no , not people -- just deer and game , but the people he catches can never be free again . they too must kill and kill , covering themselves with blood .
my little girl said she 'd kill you if you came to see me . i can 't let you die . we 'll have to hide you .
yes , yes -
now , i don 't know amy --

frida , grab that red one .
it is so hot in here .
well if he does , he didn 't give you away . he must really like you .

starving .
a man killed in central park .
he was ripped to shreds also . in his apartment .

we can just take this pillowcase .
just like that ?
you wouldn 't believe me if i told you , inspector . have patience - you 'll see for yourself .
yes . this way .
what makes you think that ! if you would learn to concentrate on facts , not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster , bumstead ...
shut-up .
this ocean business ... i know where i can find a map . i need to go back to the station . where will you be ?

the only thing left for them is the city grid ... ... they may not do it .
i would too . * they lock eyes for a moment , but it 's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other .
i 've seen enough phoney id 's in my time to recognize that the ones they 've got cost a fortune . add all that up and i don 't know what the fuck it means , but these are bad ass preps and they 're here to stay .

the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester . try and get in close over the harvester ... you 'll find this interesting sire . -- the duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester . paul can see ...
we are alone ...
do not interrupt ! ! ! do not speak lightly of the spice ... one small point ...
it 's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system . perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second . the salt is separated . breathing and walking provide the pumping action . the reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck . urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads . should you be in the open desert , remember to breathe in through your mouth , out through the nose tubes .
that 's it ... spice mining ... no other cloud quite like it . see the spotters over it ? they 're watching for wormsign ... the telltale sand waves . seismic probes on the surface , too sire ... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show ... looks like a good patch of spice .
oh great mother ! he 's trying the voice . the reverend mother said it could save him .
excellent !

pain .
no ! ! enough ! ! kull wahad ! no woman child ever withstood that much . i must have wanted you to fail . take your hand out of the box and look at it , young human ... . do it !

oh , see , studying would 've been a huge help . where were you , then ?

i insist . there clearly isn 't room for us all , i 'm the least able to dig , and i 'm not one of the walking wounded . those are facts . besides , if i remain it 's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he 's doing and rescue us . it 's hard to argue with this logic .
what 's he saying ?

real early . we 're just gon na take your car to get some breakfast .
come in , admiral .
this one i have watched a long time . all his life has he looked away ... to the horizon , to the sky , to the future . never his mind on where he was , on what he was doing . adventure , excitement ... a jedi craves not these things !
he 's too old . yes . too old to start the training .
you must . luke , look at me !
what 's wrong with him ?
why don 't we just turn him over to lando to fix ?
not now , chewie . lando , aren 't you afraid the empire might discover this little operation and shut you down ?
no , i 'm alright . i 'm alright .

yes , we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city . it 's connected by a transfer shaft .
i didn 't know you had a price on your head . vader has given you to the bounty hunter .
i didn 't say anything ?
it 's luke . get under him . slow down . easy chewie . line up your tracking system . lando , open the hatch .
are the coordinates set ?
closer ? !
sir , it 's very possible this asteroid is not stable .
oh my , no !
i 've never seen it fail .
you are reckless !

difficult to see . always in motion is the future ... back away , little machine !
foreknowledge is helpful , but painful sometimes and dangerous too . you have far to go in your training .

lancelot ? ... it is lancelot !
speak of the devil ! ...
you are the son of king uther , and the fair igrayne ... you are king arthur .
the lady of the lake . take it . take it , quickly !
i don 't know . merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own . at first , i did so because i feared merlin , later because i loved you .
love demands it .
-- nothing !
why ?
flattery ! do you think i am ignorant of your stupid little games ? preying on you weakness of others . that 's your power , a petty evil . mine is great . great plans . impossible dreams . laughable endings ...
what 's behind that beauty ? a wizened , cold-hearted snake .
fuck it .
we have to start looking for a shrink .
i can 't believe it .
you 're a nice man .
all right then we 've got clean rats .
i just heard them karl .

i told you i was gon na hit you .
and it 's especially nice to be among friends tonight , because , well , tonight 's a very special night for my brother and i . this evening we 've asked a young lady to join us , a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all . she 's making her debut here this evening and , as far as i 'm concerned , she couldn 't be doing it in a better place . because there 's one place that 's always been for us a very special place , and that place is this place , the ambassador lounge . ladies and gentlemen , please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song , miss susie diamond .
that 's it except for the first . we got the sheraton , the ambassador , or the holiday inn on sixtieth . all three-day turns .
not true . besides , jack 's the romantic .
a gift . courtesy of our courteous hotel manager , mr. daniels . we , dear brother , are a fucking smash . yup . they want us back . easter . it seems they have this egg hunt every year . only not for kids . adults . they stuff these plastic eggs with timexes and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn . then afterwards , they have a dance . an egg dance . everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open . it 's our job to separate the yolks from the whites . slippery business .
really ? isn 't that a coincidence .
what 's that mean ? thirty-eight .
catchy . you have any previous entertainment experience , miss diamond ?
the problem is i can 't hear myself sing with all this ... ... music . you know what i 'm saying ?
the carlton 's a dump . no cover . no minimum . and they water their drinks . it 's strictly for the fuller brush crowd .
maybe . i 'll call him .
he 's always right . go ahead . pick a virgin .
i told you , he 's got the gift . same with music . hears it once and he 's got it .
he 's just afraid to show it . aren 't you , little brother ?
jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle .
someone needs to grow up . i won 't take it , jack .
i just saw a man walk out of your room !
you know , i 'm feeling a lot of hostility from you .
not for money . with my mother .
yeah , well , a11 i know is mother nature must be one crazy dame . shit .
better than that .
frank wasn 't 'there .
no .
eighty proof . what d'ya say ? think you can handle it ?
merry christmas .
he hit a guard .
should be . it 's yours .
of course he is ... -- he 's yours too .
you shoot hoops like a chick , you smoke like a wuss , and -- i don 't know -- you 're different .
eve , listen carefully . the man you think is your husband -- isn 't .
the left , i think . those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody 's even broken yet .
call lazarro . castor just came out of his coma .
too late , your kid worships me . and your wife -- she 's an animal . even i can 't keep up with her .
so 's a noose . now keep your mouth shut .
i 'm going to have you fired .
what the fuck do you think happened ? castor troy just shot him ! what are you waiting for ? go !
business first . i went into the `` warrants '' system and erased your records . you 're clean . in fact , you 're now on the informant payroll .
call me spontaneous .
-- studying .
that 's what i 'd like to know . she stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off .
ooh , my suits are ready ...
her assistant said you could call her at home after eight .
uh ... actually , yes . two ... good ones .
im sure you do ...
ringing my bell ...
no , honey . go back to sleep .
maybe i dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me ...
ive got all the time in the world ...
i mean it . from what i can tell , were a mom and pop operation , were already over-extended in sales , and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier ...
look jack im late . id love to help you out some more but i got ta go handle my business ... happy trails .
yeah ... fine .
and ... ?
thats my piece . i was saving it because i got nauseated from that store bought chicken .

ben ! ben !
i can go hotter !
okay , `` mom . ''
dude . that 's my sister .
blockhead started it !
you are such a dork , reed ... you never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics .
i think you both know my director of genetic research , susan storm .
victor , are you feeling alright ?
it is . there 's something we need to talk about . something i need to ask you ...
medical 's ready .
phase two .
tell him where he fits in , will you ? i 've got a few things to check out .
come along , they 'll be operating shortly . see you later , mike .
yes ... slowed down agreat deal .
no danger of an embolism . at our reduced scale , they 're much too minute to prove fatal to benes .
not now . we need air , not greetings !
not anything built into the chassis . if it hadn 't come loose --
i feel much better now ...
not in a sealed vessel like an artery . captain -- something must be wrong with your controls !
nothing -- against all that force .
well , it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we 'd take quite a beating .
a forced joining of an artery and vein . must 've happened when benes was hurt .
it lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime . forty million beats .
fasten yourselves in . there should be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again .
just what it is . antibodies , destroying bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the system .
why not ? because of his gibberish about god and the soul ? camouflage -- that 's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you ! and to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill benes ! and you made it possible !
go ahead .
nothing you could see with the naked eye . but there 's a microscopic radio-active particle inside .
positions , please . and strap yourselves in .
enough to breathe , but that 's all .
we 're losing pressure in the flotation tanks . check the manual , right over there .
could i run a tube through that wall , without harming benes ?
what i was afraid would happen . the stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
i could use a lawnmower ...
looks simple to operate .
yeah .
chaska .
look , dad , there is no fucking way -
well ... i 'm goin ' ta bed now .
ah , dammit !
margie . thought you might need a little warm-up .
well - it 's cold , margie .

the garden . take him there . move , people . let 's do this !
i 'm afraid i have to insist you leave .
some of it , yes .
you want to see pain ? swing by first methodist tuesday nights . see the guys with testicular cancer . that 's pain .
really ?
let 's not make a big thing out of it .
do this for me , marla . do this for me , if you never do anything else ...
i can 't let myself see where you 're going . go wherever it takes you , remember ... keep away from major cities ...
don 't ask .
i did , i think . but , i 'm okay ... i 'm fine ...
that old saying , how you always hurt the one you love , well , it works both way .
tyler durden .
he was obviously able to handle it .

funny -- you look married .
well , if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble , i think they might alter their behavior . what do you think jack ...
have you ever done any cloudbusting ? you lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds ... and you try yo break them apart with your mind . it 's wild .
yeah ... ..hey they 're moving ... . am i doing that ?
oww ... man ...

eleven .
nothing 's more dangerous , especially for an old man .
let me hang on with two hands or i will fall .
going nearer to god !
he said he 's in charge ...
we must end the campaign .
that the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again .
i hope not .
even as a boy i thought so .
i don 't know ... i know you are right . i don 't know that this is right .
i mean a day of prayer and fasting . but of course no work could be done -- no buses , no trains , no factories , no administration . the country would stop .
that 's young nehru . he 's got his father 's intellect , his mother 's looks and the devil 's charm . if they don 't ruin him at cambridge -- wave ! wave ! -- he may amount to something .
there is nothing i can give .
i assure you i feel a very ordinary man at this moment .
no -- but i think i 'm going to .
it would be five thousand more .
yeah . you want to go dancing tonight ?
i 'm proud of you , vincent .
i 'm sure i could have .
michael 's .
i got the better end of the deal . i just lent you my body -- you lent me your dream .
i think i could do something provided you know what you 're doing and you can meet the terms .
those checks take forever .
i forgot something -- something at home . i 'll see you later .
we could go together one day .
need any more , you can always get it off his shoes .
new policy .
not at all , just a pleasant way to have lunch .
they 're mine . the one with the moustache is my brother . they stay out of it . we stay clean .
i heard about you . you work with miller .
what about her ? let 's c ut up the money , i want to get north .
no way . i 've got to get out now .

with mama , putting the baby to sleep . francesca 's very happy . michael was kind to her . she idolizes him . the children are all out in the speedboat . i 'm going to my house .
yeah , give me a minute .
no tom , just listen . all my people are businessmen ; their loyalty is based on that . one thing i learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think ... and on that basis , anything is possible . fredo has a good heart , but he is weak ... and stupid , and stupid people are the most dangerous of all . i 've kept you out of things , tom , because i 've always known that your instincts were legitimate , and i wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice , for your own protection . i never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under sonny ; i know you were in a position of limited power , and you did your best to advise and caution him . what i am saying is that now , for how long i do not know , you will be the don . if what i think has happened is true ; i will leave tonight , and absolutely no one will know how to contact me . and even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary . i give you complete power : over neri ... fredo , everyone . i am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children , and the future of this family , solely resting on your judgment and talent .
kay had a miscarriage ; she lost the baby .

if we put out the word . that we 're crewing-up , for a one-time-only job ... what do you think that 'll yield ?

excuse me --
what 's the matter with you ? you 're crazy .
let her carry this shit inside .
yeah . what about the kids ' school ?
jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city . he was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen . hits never bothered him . it was business . but what he really loved to do was steal . i mean , he actually enjoyed it . jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies . he was one of the city 's biggest hijackers . clothes . razor blades . booze . cigarettes . shrimp and lobsters . shrimp and lobsters were the best . they went fast .

perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me philip ?
groovy . young master of the revels , a treat for our hostess ?
tell sandy ? what ?
i dunno . i --
greetings , charles .
that 's all , for now .
what 's that , then ?
got a love affair with police work . drives me crazy with it .
too bad ...
detective eckhart ! i know ! welcome to nightmute !
twelve years younger .
about an hour ago . said he was more than happy to cooperate .
isn 't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop ? a good cop can 't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle 's missing . a bad cop can 't sleep 'cause his conscience won 't let him . you said that once , remember ?
worth pursuing ?
don 't worry . i 'll have a cool scar .
where is he ?
i told her to come .
first i need a copy of the key .
that 's right .
she 'd come to me , sometimes in the middle of the night . bruises all over her back , her upper arms . i pled with her to let me call the police , but she wouldn 't hear it . wanted to keep it a secret .
seven years .
i.a . 's calling themselves the `` corruption task force . '' can you believe that ? trying to root out any mistakes or `` oversights '' any other detectives may have made over the years . they 're turning it into a witch hunt . something on the news about it practically every night .
i 'm always all business .
me and hap . a year and a half ago . i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty . smug , cold . dead eyes . we had circumstantial evidence , but nothing to tie him to it . nothing concrete . went over every inch of that apartment .
we 're under investigation now . back in seattle . hap wanted to talk . as soon as we got back . thought he could work out some kind of deal .
good to see you , too , randy .
the phone call . the knapsack .
yes down at the station .
he . well , he ...
drop the gun , walter .
listen to me .
it 's bet in the beginning , lest the death takes you down with it . yes , that 's it . my child . my beloved child .
yes you are , my dearest . you are mine and louis ' daughter . you see louis was going to leave us . he was going to go away . but now he 's not . he 's going to stay and make you happy .
what have you done ?
sit still . it 's not finished -
i can 't . go away from me .
the workmen must have a trunk - don 't stop , cherie -
it is ! take the back stairwell -
still my beautiful child .
no . she 's frightened . she doesn 't know where she is .
and no one knows but us ...
yes , and very beautiful .
yes ...
sure ...
you have fed . you were made for this ...
of course not . it 's so easy you almost feel sorry for them .
where do you think , my idiot friend ? we 're in a nice filthy cemetery . does this make you happy ? is this fitting and proper enough ?
and what if there is no hell , or they don 't want us there ? ever think of that ?
i know . let her alone .
you finish her - if you feel so much -
the same way you do it . a series of simple gestures . only i moved too fast for you to see . i 'm flesh and blood , you see . but not human . i haven 't been human for two hundred years .
he hadn 't even been there . and all those years i thought he was dead .
it 's our version of winter . 201 and 202 . there 's scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby . enjoy .
not possible , i 'm afraid . the last ferry left hours ago . and we got a storm coming . there won 't be another one for days .
stupid . what were you thinkng ?
julie , people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers . it 's a fact .
where is everyone ? i 'll ask --
i 'll be givin ' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it .
no , this is the safe sun . it 's better than a day at the beach .
rio isn 't the capital of brazil . it was the wrong answer . sorry , we lose .
i 've got to see .
come on , you can make it .
it 's not like that . it 's not you . it 's me . my head . i want to go back . i want to be with you . i want to be fine . i want everything to be like it used to be . it just isn 't .
it 's gon na be great .
you know me to well .
wait , it 's nancy --
why ? come on , julie . think . you 'll get it . will benson -- ben 's son .
where there 's a will , there 's a way . come on .
somebody 's gone tropical on us , baby . tropical !
rio , baby !
they all start to look the same once you 've worked in one . am i right , sister ?
are you crazy ? we 're not staying here on our own .
yeah , a great weekend . forget the weather !
see , it 's not a macho thing . it 's about equilibrium in your inner ear . you could 've used a patch , but it 's too late now . get used to it . some folks just can 't sail .
they 're all dead ... dead , i tell you . ahhhh , we 're all deaaaddddd . tyrellll , joinnnn usss .
and do what with it ?
julie ? wan na tell us what is going on here ?
she 's in her room .
why don 't you stay here tonight ? get a good sleep . you can return to your command in the morning .
let us put it to the test . protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of . i 'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to hermes -- not that i believe in him any more than i do in science .
sleep well .
i think not .
i think she went to bed i saw her going toward the house
i was looking for you .
she was born before your wife returned here to die . you never knew .
you see ? thea believes it , too !
ernie , i 'm a rich tourist today . how about driving me home in style ?
bert , what 's happened to this house ? where 's mary ? where 's my kids ?
you 've never been born . you don 't exist . you haven 't a care in the world .
well , i had a car , and it was right here . i guess somebody moved it .
sure i know where he lives . he lives in bailey park .
where is she ?
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization .
i own the house . me , giuseppe martini . i own my own house . no more we live like pigs in thisa potter 's field . hurry , maria .
all in . . .
where 's my insurance policy ? oh , here . . .
no , no , martini . your boss . where is he ?
very funny . very funny .
she was here first .
hello , violet . hey , you look good . that 's some dress you got on there .
hello , vi .
i 'm not going to go , george . i changed my mind .
you see , if you shoot pool with some employee here , you can come and borrow money . what does that get us ? a discontented , lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class . and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas . now , i say . . .
i 'll take chocolate .
that does it come here .
thanks for dropping around .
lassos the stork ! you mean you . . . what is it , a boy or a girl ?
going up to see zuzu .
george , darling ! where have you been ?
hmm ? well , i . . .

we have to help him .
well damn it . i don 't speak ill of the dead . what i 'm trying to say is , its was just a crazy accident . the exact same thing could have happened if he was with me . you can 't go beating yourself up about it .
i loaned it to nash . he must have had it on him when he ...
just hold on .
i don 't think so .
we should take it with us to signal any planes .
ah yes , the first rule of academics . publish or perish .
sorry , alan it 's been six years .
no . although i 've studied them in the wild .
no we 're not .
let 's just say that through my business -- imports/exports , emerging markets -- i 've made some friends in high places . in this case , the costa rican government .
but you never came across just one .
it certainly does .
no . i feel something .
like if you shoot yourself in the foot ? wouldn 't matter . you 'd be dead before you realized you 'd accidentally pulled the trigger .
kelly ! what are you doing here ?

she 's nuts .

that little black line means death for this infant . the fibula won 't heal straight , so the ankle joint can 't pivot when he stands on his hind feet . the baby won 't be able to run , and probably can 't even walk . it 'll be crippled , and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old .
we 'll kill it with too much , we 'll put it into respiratory arrest ! i 'm almost done . damn it , i need another adhesive , something pliable i can --
i 'm trying !
jump !
where 's ian ?

i 'm sorry for the dramatic entrance , but i 'm in a hurry . will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then ?
small versions of adults , honey .
the - - agility . you 're right !

dilophosaurus .
i 'll just finish . yeah , i want to finish .

triceratops was a constant browser , and constant browsers would be constantly sick .
that 's okay . listen , give me your hand .
could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
me ? oh , hell yes . three . i love 'em . i love kids . anything at all can and does happen .
occasionally . always on the lookout for the future ex- mrs. malcolm .
dr. grant ! dr. grant !
it 's okay ! it 's okay ! it 's a brachiosaur !
you 're a beautiful big animal .
well , on the tour - - the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps . they mutated the dinosaur 's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs . now , some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female , in a single sex environment . malcolm was right ! look , life found a way !
okay . keep low . follow me .
phone security systems , everything works . you ask for it , we got it !
john , the kind of control you 're attempting is not possible . if there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us , it 's that life will not be contained . life breaks free . it expands to new territories . it crashes through barriers . painfully , maybe even.. dangerously , but and ... well , there it is .
that 's what i said ! you 're a nerd ! they don 't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds !
that was great !
and we 're in the center ring . you sure you want to wear that blazer ?
some kind of emergency back at the sheriff 's station . four deputies shot ... some kind of explosion ... i don 't know what 's going on , but they 're panicking back there .
that 's right . wasn 't on any of the maps ... we could barely see it through the underbrush . place must 've been abandoned for twenty years .
this is a legitimate cinematic genre . just like westerns , comedies , film noire , science fiction ...
a cameraman caught him on videotape . joe , i saw an entire sheriff 's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn 't there ...
checking out a theory . just keep talking to him .
for the moment ! you 've only got about two minutes left ! hurry ! ruby takes off towards the cineplex ...
up there .
yes -- that 's us .
what was the matter with it ?
should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists ? why i became a murderer ? because murder ... is bliss . it 's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil -- once you 've adopted its procedure .
we saw her naked once -- didn 't we .
it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being .
here too ! they 're all in a dreadful muddle !
no !
are you kidding ? ! that heap of junk will never leave the ground !
jack ! ... jack !
it ' s alright jack ... it ' s alright .

murray .
any day .
maybe . i said maybe . what i mean is , ah ... i don 't think it 'll really work out , but charley seems to want it , so ...
a moment .
yes . i am ready .
do not worry , holiness . they fight for you . they are under your protection .
it is alright , father .
no !
yes , yes . your brothers are here .
we do not know .
the radio contact said one officer had died . then he said , `` the chinese soldiers -- they are coming . '' and then , the radio went dead .
i had relinquished doubt .
the people will not allow it .
you decide .
i have smarter men .
why is your beard so funny ? let me touch this .
oh , yes .
go ahead .
if he 's eaten in the area , he shouldn 't be far away . crocs hang around the food source .
you don 't want to cut me down . 'cause i 'll kill you .
it came from across the lake .
i don 't know !
jack . we 've all seen it . he 's probably a hundred and fifty years old , he 's bigger than an elephant .
tranq guns down , rifles up !
u.s. wildlife won 't send anybody without a confirmation .
you 're not okay , your leg 's a mess .
skipping stones . look how flat that water is , you can get ten skips on a good one .

he heeds a tourniquet .

i don 't know . it was like a tug . something tugged us .
i think . my hair . where 's hector ? ! where is he ?
other than feeling slightly embarrassed , i 'm perfectly fine . could you cut me down ?
i don 't know . back the truck --
wait .
stay cool . just remember to call him `` god . ''
agent mapp ! thank you !
okay , mr. yow ...
what was it ?
got dressed without turning on the light . i went downstairs ... outside ...
i don 't know . i had no food or water . it was very cold . i thought - if i can even save just one ... but he got so heavy . so heavy ...
did you breast-feed her ?
why did they turn back ?
top of this ridge . fort and lake george are downhill of it .
miss . may i ?
i don 't know . whatever happens you stay with your father . you stay among the officers .
alice ?
winter with the delaware , my father 's cousins . and in the spring , cross the ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called can-tuck-ee .
yes . yes , i will .
it can be dangerous ...
he delivered no such message .
i am sorry , duncan ...
what the bloody hell plan is this ?
only chance we got is ... ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground !
: only one or two loads .
sir ! upon the center , wheel to the left- about ! march ! rear ranks , proper distance ! front ranks , take your distance ! march ! halt ! make ready !

our only chance is to lure it to the swamp and flush it like we did the other .
seeing how my stock 's doing ...
where 's jones ?
you 're only twenty-five tons off quota . barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day . it 's just a day off . you don 't have to take it , i just thought it might help .
charge set . backing off . c'mon rover let 's get out of here .
don 't thank me , yet , but it is important to know where you 're going and who your friends are ... 'know what i mean ?
i realize you must have gone through hell --

d'artagnan .
my guards are useless ! take her from me !

making the key to the throne .

to the bastille . and death .
jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane . if we are to have a place of private prayer , where better than here , beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river ?
i don 't know about you , but i plan to wait here .
at a ball , everyone watches the king !
it 's a prison , you idiot ! they don 't expect anyone to try getting in ! the problem will come when we want out !

yes , your holiness ?
andy , i 'm calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry . but -- i need your permission to fire him .

your muscles have atrophied . we 're rebuilding them .
you 've never used them before .
what is real ? how do you define real ? if you 're talking about your senses , what you feel , taste , smell , or see , then all you 're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain .
what 's going on ?
ten hours straight . he 's a machine .
i need the main wet-wall .
yes , sir .
he is the one . he is the one !
shit , i 'm sorry .
we think you 're bugged . try to relax .

hi , jennifer .
goodnight to you , susan .

please . we don 't need to talk about drew .
-- i guess you haven 't .
it was everything .

he wanted to ride back down with you . now sit and relax , get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
he doesn 't care . but thanks anyway .
joe ?
i don 't know .
i don 't care if you love him ! i 'm telling you he 's no good for you !
i 'm having a helluva time .
yes , but --
that 's why it 's okay .
the fireworks are about to start .
it 's simple , you just go to the bathroom .
what ?
no . but the photo on his license looked familiar . i think he 's been in the bar before
yeah . you ?
they don 't look too hard for guys like jimmy .
maybe i can help you find him . i know a * lot of people .
what happened is that jimmy went to meet a guy called teddy . he took a lot of money with him and he didn 't come back . jimmy 's partners think i set him up . i don 't know whether you know this teddy or how well -
thanks .
i don 't remember . see , i have no short- * term memory . it 's not amnesia - *
you 're in a playful mood .
you called me . you wanted my help . you know , lenny , i 've had more rewarding friendships than this one . although i do get to keep using the same jokes .
no ! should i ?
why ?
yeah . i think it was your sinister mustache that got him .
because she 'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage . she 's already got you staying with her , for fuck 's sake .
wouldn 't be appropriate . *
there 's a guy in here , hurt bad ! we got ta get him to a doctor !
are you sure ?
quit it ! * * you 're not a killer , lenny . that 's why * you 're so good at it . *
you can 't just take it !
this bad cop . he checked you into the * discount inn . then he 's been calling you * for days , sticking envelopes under your * door , telling you shit . *
his name 's james f. grantz , john g. check * your tattoos . *
a load of amphetamine i told him i had .
fuck you ; i gave you a reason to live and * you were more than happy to help . you lie * to yourself ! you don 't want the truth , * the truth is a fucking coward . so you * make up your own truth . *
then that 's it . change the mission statement . crockett stays in . he keeps working up the ladder . the local importers get a pass for the time being .

haiti and puerto rico . money through dubai and geneva maybe .
... what else , what else did he indicate to you ? i need to know everything he said .
we think nlr . we don 't know ! alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet . he wasn 't deep into the crew .
he 's talking to you , bro . what he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization ...
they 're serious . they 're cautious . they 'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery 's handled ... they 'd walk away , rather than compromise operational security ... that 's good .
do we need this ... ?
sure you 're all right ?
no . of course not . just something struck me funny ...
not a cent , i swear to god , i swear on my mother 's eyes .

and you 're very brilliant , and you must be a good man , or you could never have created such a wondrous , loving creature as misery chastain . like a baby . all done .
my pleasure .
i know you didn 't mean it when you killed her , and now you 'll make it right .
the rain ... sometimes it gives me the blues .
you did perfect . except for one thing . this time we need two glasses .

affirmative .
you noticed . what 're you going to do ? spank me ?
i 'm fine..

i 'm going to answer it .
sure ...
go secure .
always .
i didn 't touch it .
i 'd say you 've got about two minutes .
wonderful . ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel . you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years ? his wife 's got a year old kid . so he says `` all right . who was it ? my friend harry ? '' she says no . `` oh , it was my friend sammy . '' she says it wasn 't sammy . `` oh , i suppose it was my friend lou . '' `` no , what 's the matter , don 't you think i have any friends of my own ? ! ''
i was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was , standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking im dead and gone . god knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done , i..
but , he didnt know about you . in all fairness , ethan , claire was never convinced her charms would work with you . but i was supremely confident - having tastes the goods . `` thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife '' , ethan . oh , ethan is in love with you , claire , make no mistake about it . and like all the worlds lovers , hes tortured by the same , one pathetic question - `` does she feel the same way i do ? ''
ethan - ive always taught you , nothing can be more dangerous than the truth . it can kill you .
and a lonely ass .
doesn 't mean it 's a signal . could just be the hard drive heating up .
this wasnt what we discussed .
phew ! weve got five minutes ...
you 're not gon na marry him , cosmo . do you love him , loretta ?
you 're rich as roosevelt . you 're just cheap , cosmo .
i don 't know , rose . i don 't know where i 've been , and i don 't know where i 'm going . you should have your eyes opened for you , my friend .
hello , mr. castorini .
they are little stars and birds . birds fly to the stars , i guess .
i 'm calling for your brother johnny . he 's getting married and he wants you to come .
what ?
i think that 's it .
yeah . it smells like snow .
hi .
johnny .

my scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes .
you propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement .
hi . why ain 't you at the store ?
if i hit the stick too hard , the apple will split . if i am too timid , the apple will fall off the stick .
it was a miracle !
it 's nothing !
yes .
good night .
you see that moon last night ?
i knew she had it .
quiet ! quiet ! there are ways of telling whether she is a witch .
it is i , arthur , son of uther pendragon , from the castle of camelot . king of all britons , defeator of the saxons , sovereign of all england !
then we 'd best leave them here and carry on on foot .

yes , my liege . stand by for attack ! !
oh , just some friends !
i warned you !
do me a favour .
that 's all right . see you on thursday .

no , really , i can cope . i can handle this lot easily !
ector .
stop saying the word ! the word we can not hear ! the word ...
did i tell you ? did you listen to me ? oh no , no , you knew better didn 't you ? no , it 's just an ordinary rabbit isn 't it . the names you called me . well , don 't say i didn 't tell you .
... least of all my son . it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave .
back and upper corridors .
yes . i do .
a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen . it was remiss of me not to come earlier .
i 've been called back to london . my last day . i thought i might take a walk on lochnagar .
oh , several things .
to know when he 'll be king .
excellent !
they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness .
getting there . it 's more sensitive than a joy-stick . your video-character can respond as fast as you can . but what can i do for you ?
it 's a tough game . hard to pin that bastard down . keeps on changing the rules .
there 's something wrong with arcade . the game 's alive somehow ...
he 's probably outside . you know how he is . gets bored ...
guess he took off ... you have his keys , right ?
laurie 's .
what ? !
my house . i want to try something .
drives 'em crazy every time .
i can 't believe you made it !
everything .
a way to hook this helmet into the game . i 'm sure there are interfaces ...
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level . once we get all the keys , we can unlock arcade 's heart . and then ...
right , then ...
we don 't have a choice !
there never is .
i just thought of something . if we came back from the game ... ... what if arcade did too ?
hold my keys , then .
then we 'll go home .
that way .
in this world , wrong is right !
oh god ... oh god ...
in case things get too intense . it automatically freezes the game , gives you a breather . things can get pretty wild ...
sign me up .
i 'm ruth 's niece . my name 's betty . i 'm sure she told you i was coming .

i 'm leaving .

okay thanks , atta girl .
her favorite poet .
and no boys , promise me , oh those la people are all so corrupt you 'll end up pregnant and on drugs ... and don 't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer ... and don 't make eye contact , it communicates an implied vulnerability .
it means ... i 'm a paranoid nitwit who 's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he 's a paranoid nitwit . so why don 't you just say & quot ; oh dad & quot ; and get on the damn plane already ?
phil 's moving to la , grammoo 's passing , the baby being born , vada 's report , i think ...
maybe he 's hungry .

jerk ! you idiot ! ! !
this is a totally barbaric custom .
no ... it was me . and i 'm sorry mom , really , ju ... just tell me what to do , i 'll do anything .
i 'd consider it a personal favor .
bye .

he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me ...
he says , `` swear . when we 're both 28 , if we 've never been married ... we marry each other ! ''
desperate . to talk .
don 't be ridiculous , we 're having a serious conversation !
i can 't even say it .
i can be quick . i can even be funny .
... cigars in bed ? i broke him on that . but the bathroom 's a swamp , he wears reeboks to dinner , tells the same , admittedly funny , jokes three hundred times ...
... whatever is manly and independent .
we settled this . and i reneged . that wasn 't fair .
... well , maybe it works on fingers , too .
i hope so . this is all too mysterious to waste on just me .
mirrors .
you keep saying that .

more or less ...
we still got a few tricks up our sleeves .
what he said . we didn 't know jack shit about and riot . it just happened . it was kismet . we didn 't even know those people . how are we supposed to organize a riot when we 've been in fuckin ' isolation for the past year ? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits . i mean , it 's not like we care . if they wan na say we masterminded the whole thing , let 'em . it won 't exactly keep us up at night . but you said you wanted the truth , and the truth is we were just lucky .

he 's close ...
i don 't know .
i think so .
she 's been waiting outside your office since breakfast .
it 'll be my last chance . pleese ?
thank you .
but i couldn 't go until i told you how sorry i am for all the things i 've done .
breathe deeply and relax ... starting with your toes , relax everything until there 's no tension left in your bodies . none at all . keep following the pendulum ...
everybody take five .
freddy krueger . he was a child murderer before he died . after he died , he became ... something worse . six years ago freddy killed my friends . he almost killed me . i thought i got rid of him -- but i guess he was too strong .

yes . the thing is ... i have to go away today but i wondered , if i didn 't , whether you might let me see you a bit ... or , a lot maybe ... see if you could ... like me again .
that 's fine . there 's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict .
and this is william .
c'est la vie ... we 're lucky in lots of ways , but ... surely it 's worth a brownie .
right .
i 'm sorry i 'm so late . bollocksed up at work again , i fear . millions down the drain .

hello . i wonder if i could have a little word .

yes , thank you , miss ratched . since our last meeting i have been reflecting , quite seriously , on the nature of my problem . naturally , i 'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain ... no , no . to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function ... regardless of the function , we will confront the question of ... yes . yes . the question of ... existence ... relationship ... function ... confront ... yes , confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis ... yes , the crisis of our souls . of our souls , which i am trying to fully understand the problem ... the problem . not to shut ourselves off , but somehow ... somehow to understand fully our capacity ... to obtain ... to personify ... the question ... existence depends ... depends on the question ... to reflect ... to reflect ...

home of the brave .
i 'm out of fuel !

nice to meet you , betty .
there 's nothing you can do here , they 'll die or they won 't , we just --
i have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission .

peggy sue !
goodbye , grandma .
well , besides charlie , of course .

that 's because you ' re not a total moron like they are .
that loudmouthed little bitch~
michael fitzsimmons ! is he here ?
you better watch out for her . she 's after charlie .
i don 't buy them anymore . you were the only one who drank them .
pretty strange .
save it .
let 's go down to the basement .
it opens , too . look inside .
i know .
she seems confused , irresponsible , overemotional . my wife says that 's the way girls act sometimes .
i wish i had the nerve . and the figure .
what a treat .
peggy sue 's still stuck on treble without a cause .
doing some shopping ?
open it .
i want everybody to hear because i don 't have anything to be ashamed of .
i went for a drive . up in the hills .
way to go , mom !
we 've got to move fast . this is an idea whose time has come .
you know , you two are wonderful parents . i 'm really going to try to behave myself .
rosalie testa !
confucious says , the way out is through the door . there 's a truck . there 's your door .
i suppose so .
uh ... no . you just ... look different than you sounded on the phone . please , come in .
nothing . i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs .
remember zowie , drew 's dog ? he got hurt again . i 'm going over to take a look at him .
i can bring her back . the same way drew and me brought zowie back ...
all set .
anywhere but here .
zowie .
you have to bury your own . that 's the way the indians did it . it 's like a rule ...
you know everything , don 't you ?
because they deserve to , walter .
yeah . thanks , guys .
he 's not sorry , okay , fine . why don 't we see what we find out from the blood work ? i 'll work on getting a specimen , i 'm sure hospital food could help in that direction . maybe , by then , we 'll hear from my doctor , and we 'll go from there . okay ? everybody happy ?
you 're not going to like this . please try to smile ...
no sweat , buddy .
of course .
more than your friend . family .
funny .
charles , i must apologize again , for the kronos mishap . it was a scary few minutes around here . wow . but thank god , the complaint was found . and no damage was done .
as in , the vegetable ?
one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead .
you bet . we 'll see you later .
you had one guy `` like that ? ''
it 's a fucking staircase ! go over it ! go over it !
yeah , yeah -- we 're all fuckin ' amazed . anyone not ready for this ?
it was just somebody else . from the crash . he was just ... .
what it 's gon na be like when we hit that canyon . with her bleeding .
it 's starting ... .
carolyn fry . i 'd shake hands , but ...
what 'd owens mean ? 'bout not touching the switch ?
fuck . guess i 'm more glad to be here than i thought .
nothing we can 't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts .
stay in the light ! everybody ! stay in the fucking --
for now .
he 's running us 'round in circles . look for yourself . look !
anyone else having breathing problems ? aside from me ?
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system . here . this wooten here -- easy , easy . very rare .
maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern india . very rare .
not staying in here another ... .
hard to tell , sometimes ... even for me ... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin ' each other 's gonads off . thought we 'd swing wide . okay by you ?
so much for my cocktail hour .
doesn 't need to be . use this to get back up to the sol-track shipping lanes , stick out a thumb . you 'll get picked up . right ?
that 's correct . and you will both stand trial for heresy .
zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone . that 's what we 'll try for . what about you ?
it empties into a sea some miles from here . that 's where the cave is .
oh , cornelius , be quiet .
and even if it weren 't , why fly ? where would it get you ?
there was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us .
you 're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet . your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries . even if you could get back , they 'd think you were something that fell out of a tree .
i don 't know . this beast lost a lot of blood .
okay .
try telling them our names .
keep moving . we can 't turn back now .
dr. zira ! silence that man !
let us assume , as common sense dictates , that the prisoner 's story is false . but if he does not come from another planet , then surely he sprang from our own . yes , sprang . as an animal psychologist , i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute .
don 't be a fool . you 're outnumbered and outgunned .
cease fire ! withdraw !
he has a point . on my planet children often play with ape dolls .
barnes comes from hell .
wrong ? you ain 't ever been right - 'bout nothing . and dig this you assholes and dig it good ! barnes been shot 7 times and he ain 't dead , that tell you something ? barnes ain 't meant to die . only thing can get barnes ... is barnes !
over here !
out there man - behind the log .
no !
dawn ...
no ... i move faster alone .
go on , whatcha got ta lose , yo ' here now ...
i remember first time you came in here taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard .
bah , you 're a child , lerner . rhah don 't waste time on you .
barnes took a bullet right there . at ia drang valley ... and the cocksucker survived - that 's baaad man . that 's his high , baby . high on war !
i 'm trying very hard to be polite about it .
just drunk enough .
disgusting , aren 't they ? if you really want a martini , i know where you can get one .
no thanks .
yes , i 've seen it before .
positive ?
not quiet yet .
we 'll see you next week , and if --
yes .
sit on that log , dear .
don 't tell me you 've actually read it , jeremy .
i see .
a glamorous young lady way above his station ...
we were just chortling over that . blas and epicene . it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary . so -- i hope you don 't mind , edward , i pinched it for my piece today .
come on . hand over .
i 'm not sure .
we might be able to dig out a couple of suez survivors for you .
tom . .. bed ! go on .
only make bets i can 't afford to lose . only way to be 100 % committed .
news , last night ... those guys , the ex-presidents ... they robbed my bank yesterday . and i was just there the day before , cashing a check . see ... look . assured trust ... same place .
'one shot stopping ' ... good , very good . i like you , johnny . i like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . i respect that . it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . here , hold it . check out the weight .
after you , alfonse . i insist !
insurance policy . now this is going to sting a bit , but it 's for your own growth , brah . press play .
see ! that 's what i like about you , man ! you 're just sharp as a razor blade .
what if your chute fails , bodhi ? rescind the order . let her off the hook , she 's served her purpose . do it , man , you owe me that much . let me hear it before you check out .
jesus christ , bodhi !
yeah , they control the room well . stick strictly to the cash drawers .
nice tattoo , dietz .
he rents it for the summer . bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . most a these guys can 't keep a job . when the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride .
swell 's here , johnny . bodhi always knows .
yeah . i just want to sit out here for a minute .
warm them up .
probably another rebel patrol . they operate in here all the time .
right behind you .
we found 'em both , dead . and the gear from the chopper . if they 're central american , i 'm a fuckin ' chinaman . by the looks of 'em , i 'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia . another thing , major , we were lucky ... couple of those guys we waxed are russians , military advisors by the look of it . something big was about to happen here .
i saw it .
same business , guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment ...
then let 's go . it 's worth 300 just so i don 't have to drive .
no shit . they expensive ?
you 're forgiven .
dinner can wait .
he died a long time ago .
hmm ... let 's see ... no , there 's something missing .
i don 't want you to get too excited ... these are on loan ... however ...
i 'm leaving . don 't ya see ? if i stay with you like you want me to , there 'll always be some guy , your friends eve , treatin ' me like that ... thinkin ' they 're allowed to . what are you gon na do , fight 'm all ? no . i 'll take my money now , please .
afternoon .
we don 't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . besides ... you 've already impressed everyone you need to , haven 't you ?
have a good day , gentlemen .
i bet . that was our rent !
do i ! ? momma !
i 'm just looking , thanks .
you survived the fire swamp . you must be very brave ... ... but nobody withstands the machine . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 69 .
of course .
then why is there fear behind your eyes ?
i am no one to be trifled with , that is all you ever need know .
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything .
nonsense -- you 're only saying that because no one ever has . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 57 .
now , was that so terrible ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 64 .
veer left . left . left !
his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering ? excuse me --
everybody ... move ! !
i always think everything could be a trap -- which is why i 'm still alive .
-- power too -- promise me that --
that is a noble cause . give me the sixty-five , i 'm on the job .
okay . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 97 .
thank you -- i 've worked hard to become so .
i ought to be after twenty years .
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself . however , since i can 't have you following me either --
-- there 's nothing to explain . you 're trying to kidnap what i 've rightfully stolen . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 43 .
good . then pour the wine .
you 'd like to think that , wouldn 't you ? you 've beaten my giant , which means you 're exceptionally strong . so , you could have put the poison in your own goblet , trusting on your strength to save you . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but , you 've also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied . and in studying , you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
i 'll tell you in a minute . first , let 's drink -- me from my glass , and you from yours .
you only think i guessed wrong -- -- that 's what 's so funny ! i switched glasses when your back was turned . you fool .
then account for yourself ! do you believe in god ? do you believe in gold ? why are you looking up old lady 's dresses ? bit of a pervert , eh ?
i 'm going to buy a toy . i worked very , very hard and i think i deserve a toy .
to failure !
what is it ?
he 's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel . he 's taken money from little old ladies . he 's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of . especially me . but who has he really hurt ?
i can 't . i can 't do it . it 's a demon . it 's a gargoyle , it 's a monster ... but it 's still my child .
of course i need you . it 's dark in there .
nice girl .
no ! no ! we don 't make love . go to work .
here i come , ready or not .
and after that we 'll play the abduction and cruel rape of lucretia ... and i 'll play lucretia .
oh , i 'd better hurry back . i don 't want to miss one minute of it .
money .
wouldn 't have been able to tail you if you did .
teddy called . me ... and my mother called to see if teddy called . oh , and your sister called to say she 's going to tucson to do some buying and she 'll be gone the whole weekend and ...
it didn 't get washed down . it 's figuring ... the kind you tear up and get rid of . some figure has been added to or subtracted from ... forty thousand .
i could stand something regular .
it 's all for you . i 'm not hungry . please go ahead .
now what ?
let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking .
you must remember that bad business out there . about ten years ago ...
have you two had breakfast ?
better sign in first , hasn 't we ?
uh , uh ! my boss is paying for this trip ... ninety percent business ... and he wants practically notarized receipts . i better sign in and get a receipt .
i didn 't think so .
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away .
nothing . here , let 's clear the path .
you must 've seen an illusion , sam . now , i know you 're not the seeing- illusion type ... but no woman was illusion there and i don 't believe in ghosts , so there it is !
oh , nothing . a cou- ple of my patients having a little argument .
he isn 't here .
yes , the child ...
i 'll have it for supper . so long .
well , thank goodness , that 's settled .
i 'm going to get even with you , you dirty stiff ! i 'll do it !
yes .
he can 't hear you .
don 't lose sight of him . this is the most important thing in my life .
yes ... .
it 's an experiment .
god . i dunno . the eternal nothingness . mia .
i have a knack for designing clothes . but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook .
oh , waski , you don 't even know what we 're talking about .
i do wish you 'd speak to brother . it 's true he 's been looking at those horrible little books again .
fine .
it 'll do just fine . bye-bye , see you later .
i am thinking particularly of the other ovary . as a rule i don 't believe in removing it . the woman 's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed , she is subject to possibly serious depression , she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example , her breasts might shrink and become flabby , facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features , and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished , especially in a girl or young woman . for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary , as a rule . do you follow me ?
well , it 's rather interesting about brother , actually . i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old . he looked at me and understood me , he knew exactly who i was . i know it sounds crazy but it 's true . he 's very remarkable , he was born for the ministry and could move millions , but he doesn 't know that yet . i have to warn you about him , he can be very dangerous , there is an evil streak in him , a streak of pure sheer meanness . but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn 't know it .
doll , you and waski run on , too .
i can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt .
it 's personal . we 'll hook up at billy-boy 's pad in an hour . see ya then .
welcome to beverly hills . wife-swapping capital of the world .
beats me . you got a suggestion , feel free to shout it out , genius .
we 're gon na rain on zimmermann 's parade .
feeling great .
yeah . happy fourth of july .
it 's go time , billy-b .
what was i supposed to do ?
we have to find kittle .
we 've got the tape to prove it .
you are such a disappointment , benny .
nothing 's broke . keep sewing . and quit pacing , you big ox . you 're making me skittish .
whatever goes bang .
your wish is my command .
i 'm well aware of that .
who the fuck knows ? we 'll find out soon enough .
billy ! billy !
so there 's nobody around to get killed in the explosion .
keep 'em busy .
that 's the problem with expensive tastes ... the more you got , the more you got to lose .
yeah , she 's comin ' up .
now don 't get jittery , luke . there are a lot of command ships . keep your distance though , chewie , but don 't look like you 're trying to keep your distance .
yeah , i just got a funny feeling . like i 'm not gon na see her again .
i don 't know .
hold me .
lando !
you , too .
all right , hang on .
hello , i think ... i could be mistaken . they 're using a very primitive dialect . but i do believe they think i am some sort of god .
i 'm rather embarrassed , general solo , but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor .
red leader standing by .
now ... come on , han , old buddy . don 't let me down .
here goes nothing .
he says there 's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge .
obi-wan once thought as you do .
i will not fight you , father .
your father he is .
yes .
remember , a jedi 's strength flows from the force . but beware . anger , fear , aggression . the dark side are they . once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny .
say ! do any of you guys know the madison ?
it 's alright janet , we 'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right .
yes .
makes you cry
the delivery boy .
creature of the night .
to you , to me it 's thursday .
ohh !
my mother told me just the opposite . she said , 'you weren 't born with much of a body so you 'd better develop your brain . '
hey , i ain 't cryin ' ... i still fight . kinda do it like a hobby . see i 'm a natural southpaw an ' most pugs won 't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin ' an ' look awkward -- southpaw means lefthanded ... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best , right ?
yeah -- my ol ' man who was never the sharpest told me -- i weren 't born with much brain so i better use my body .
i must be goin ' deaf 'cause i thought ya said , 'ten cents . '
'night , marie .
thanks , mick -- i 'm gon na try .
that 's not roger . it 's one of doom 's men . he killed r.k. maroon .
eddie , come on .
just haven 't been this close to toontown for awhile .
that 's how he gets rid of the troublemakers . it 's a combination of acetone , turpentine and paint remover . he calls it the ... final solution .
that was the idea .
baker 's man ... but no use ruinin ' a good pair of shoes over it .
yeah , that 's better .
get away from there .
no , it 's not .
hey , it 's the will . i , marvin acme , of sound mind and body , hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters ...
romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! i conjure thee by rosaline 's bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh ! o , romeo that she were an open ass , and thou a poperin pear ! romeo , good night : i 'll to my truckle-bed ; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep .
benedicite ! what early tounge so sweet saludeth me ?
farewell , ancient lady ; farewell ,
to make a point . i don 't know her , and i was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk . i don 't particularly like you , so imagine what i 'll do if you try anything ...
is that right ?
the deal ? the deal is we leave for nice at first light .
you lose them !
not yet ...
alright ? it 's bloody fucking freezing in here !
not likely . once , yeah , i was -- but there wasn 't an inch of profit in it , and i 'm a cash oriented girl , if you take my meaning . i 'm a hired gun , same as the rest of you , and that 's all any of us needs to know about the other .
there 's a problem ...
should any of you decide to rush me , i 'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time .
i 'll destroy whatever 's in the case .
i got this gig through a contractor . and he most definitely didn 't know who was doing the hiring , only that they were paying a lot of money ...
it 's done .
because if there 's more than one party involved , if we really are working for different people , then perhaps some of us are on different sides . your orders might be different from mine .
hello , my friend . he doesn 't look french to me , vincent .
i know cops -- and you 're no cop .
they 'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york , and it would still get fucked up .
you need to know a lot of shit , vincent .
you weren 't around when i woke up , i thought maybe something had happened . this has been one very fucked up job , sam , and i 'm not taking any more chances on anybody ... including you ...
i know of him .
yes .
yeah . we need out fucking heads examined .
it 's an international thing . several different peoples involved , criminals from all over the world , experts brought together to do a job . but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together . an unlikely group of partners .
how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us ?
i might know where you could get a copy .
the russian would be easier .
hey dwayne why don 't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin ?
looks like some kind of drug deal or something , they 're not from around here -- one of them 's still alive .
sure thing , and --
they 're out of towners ... arizona plates ...
what 's that ?
well i mean it this time . come on . let 's get this over with !
there it is ... now what about the others ?
i know , i know . dwayne 's dead , but we can deal with it . we 'll pin it on him . the dea was driving jesse 's car . no car phone . no radio . they couldn 't have called me in .
dwayne had the opportunity , just like us . he was at the scene . he grabbed the cash . of course . this is perfect !
hello .
it 's odd . i don 't know how denning had the time , or the ability to buy something local , based on his situation .
well i was just throwing out ideas ...
we had hounds down at the scene , the footprint trail was a bust . and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity .
this just might be our ticket !
don 't you think i would have told you that !
we are having a sale on some items over here --
i mean at least pick a more discreet place , the scalp , under the armpit , under the tongue , someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look .
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow , no drugs in her system , no foul play .
yeah . that 's all i need , to become one of your in-laws .
i don 't know ...
calm down --
right behind you .
we got ta , jesse . it 's tough , but you didn 't leave us any choice . we got ta know where the tapes are .
hi .
well , same ol ' same ol ' .
yeah . figured you could have it .
i 'm up a hundred and fifty-grand . that 's a ferrari . do they sell those here in the gift shop ? somebody cash me out !
she 's walking back towards the door .
we can help you . i 'm a detective in hong kong .
that was the name of ricky tan 's boat .
no problem .
no . it 's a sample . you guys ever heard of the superbill ?
excuse me ?
i 'm fine .
they asked for the best street man i had .
okay , i 'll slow down . so we go downtown and we ask you a few questions ... you know , like what 's your name ? how old are you ? you ever expose yourself in public ... shit like that .
let me give you a piece of advice : never touch another man 's radio . you do it again , nobody , not rhonda , not yolanda , gon na save your ass .
come on !
no , no . i 'm full . too much fin and hump , you know , gives me gas . scuse me .
i got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours .
it 's him .
going into the restaurant .
i am sorry , but i have too much respect for women .
be sorry for soon young . she has no chance now .
well , i ain 't goin ' to china . and neither are you .
you know him ?
where 'd you get it ?
with the fbi . what do you think i 'm talking about ?
it 's okay . for restaurants .

i 'm waitin ' here for a name .
you don 't . he finds you . through his people .
you bet ya , coach .
thank you .
he 's here ! ... he 's here !
yes , rubbing your ears is very soothing . cory does that to me when i hyperventilate .
but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all . each one was convinced that she was perfect for them , but they didn 't see her . and she never showed up so they couldn 't see her . it 's a very symbolic thing happening . she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be .
don 't knock drunk guys in bars . drunk guys in bars are good . it means they 're not driving .
splendid dissection of maggie carpenter , very professional job .
bye , betty . thanks .
ah , beautiful . i just can 't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that .
nervous ? not at all ! no . i 've never been more certain in my life . except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams .
despite what you think , i don 't do it on purpose . and i have no intention of doing it again .
but the most interesting thing here is that i don 't see the rose tattoo that i 've heard about on your back .
still sweet .
gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss .
yeah . it 's kind of nice .
missed me bad , huh ?
i borrowed it from this guy i know . so ?
no sauntering down the aisle . just make time . let 's just get there .
happy new year .
oh , it 's just becky , she 's having trouble with rich again . hold on , becky , i 'm going downstairs .
yes . some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony .
i couldn 't do it . how did i get here ?
it 's a sign i 've watched this movie too many times . i 'm so stupid . from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio , i 've been a complete jerk .
and you crazy ? he thinks shows like this are dumb . if you didn 't have an 800 number i could never get away with this --
yes .
sure you do --
the cabinets have to be redone --
victoria ? she 's okay .
it might be in the kitchen .
you look good yourself .
i don 't make policy .
it never ends .
sure . where they 're negotiating . in the company office . we 'll go up there and picket the place .
got to talk to the brothers .
i 'm sorry . the fire 's gone out .
it 's nothing . just a little catch ...
sure .
yeah . lots of provocation lately . they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge , maybe they can bust the strike .
papa ! we seen 'em ! two scabs ! over there !
she 's coming . charley vidal gave her a lift .
nothing , i 'm trying to remember ...
come on , cheer up . it could be worse .
i try .
i just can 't . okay ?
look , maybe you oughta ' leave .
it 's tom .
no . i 'm good .
it 's you ! i didn 't have a picture or nothin ' so i had to describe you to the guy . not bad though , huh ?
are you kidding me ? a bunch of amped -out tweakers ? it was easy .
understand what ?
secret recipe .
big bill .
okay ! okay !
i didn 't fucking do anything ! i swear to god !
don 't be . i 'm worried about the kid .
tell me what ?
standard vig . minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn , who 's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory .
pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant .
it speaks !
why are you doing this ?
good work , flynne . you 're a first-rate rat .
maybe he isn 't showing .
... alright , let me know when .
thank you , sir .
wade , sarge , corporal insect , all of us , hell , i 'll bet even the captain has a mother .
looks like a flaming asshole to me .
of course , sir .
nope , he ain 't wade .
what deal ?
they don 't send planes to put out machine guns . two flank runners with surpressing fire . i 'm going right , whoever goes left has to be fast .
keep trying .
that 's general gavin 's . his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it , i 'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger , i 'll get court marshaled . if you were to take it , they 'd shoot me .
a machine gun .
how about you shut up and take your position ?
rolls to his feet . fire another burst . kills the last of the german riflemen . doesn 't pause . runs onto the field .
let 's just find someplace .
out of the mouth of babes .
let 's hope , because we 're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here .
i coach the baseball team , too .
more tanks ... ryan lot 's of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation . they know that they are dead men . they settle into their positions , and prepare to fire and die .
yeah , yeah . i want you right next to me , no matter where i go , you understand ?
alright , come with me .
i won 't need to sir , it 's already here , behind the barricade so ...
yes , sir .
races through the debris . trailed by bullets .
what are we likely to run into ?
captain , he 's fast !
since i was nine years old . they got a lot of explosives around mines . me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw . damn , we had fun !
it 's easy , it runs in my family , take my grandfather , for example ...
he 's a mess !
i admit nothing .
read it .
well , since i 'm not only your father , i 'm also your friend ; i had to get you two presents .
look at those eyes .
yeah .
it 's the worst job since keymaster .
bye .
okay , good , this is all very noble .
your car ?
dude , i can 't do it !
i love you too .
i got a question . if you guys know so much about women , how come you 're here at like the gas 'n ' sip on a saturday night completely alone , drinking beers , no women anywhere ?
it 's a beautiful city .
it 's up to you .
good .
these people , my people , i want my people .
the guards aren 't allowed on the factory floor . they make my workers nervous .

where you going ?

i mean , i 'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater . your girlfriend christine is in there . she 's all alone . everyone 's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start . i 've got my knife .
i 'm gale weathers , author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders , and anchorwoman for total entertainment . maybe you 've heard of me ?
ben damon . christine perkins . sarah darling . tom prinze . that 's four , last time i learned how to count .

she was randy 's only girlfriend . . . ever .
sid , this is detective kincaid .
nevermind , what 'd you two find ?
well if you were in my shoes , dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis , you 'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick .
oh shit it 's my cell !
oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? ''
i don 't want them , i want you ! it 's simple . you show yourself , they survive , you run , they die !

none . which i don 't understand . he had to get back out .
a switchblade .
we 're screwed . he 's fucking with us .

hallo , this is dick halloran again . i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel .
now i 'm awfully glad you asked me that , lloyd , because i just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet . i was afraid they were going to be there until next april . so here 's what : you slip me a bottle of bourbon , a glass and some ice . you can do that , can 't you , lloyd ? you 're not to busy , are you ?
your money 's no good here .
god , i 've never seen anything like this before . are all of these indian designs authentic ?
yeah .
lots of ideas . no good ones .
no , nothing at all .
good .
i think he did it to himself .
i don 't think that 's true . i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny ... and i 'd like to know what they are .
jack ...

nice to meet you , mr. ullman .

mary , i 'll meet you outside .
but there 's a sad catch to the story .
that smell ... oh , god .
i wish i were . i wish i had done it , then i could confess and you 'd be at peace . that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved , i wish you had an enemy , so i could beat him up .

i 'll take her with me to the university tomorrow . i can 't believe i read the test wrong . i didn 't see anything that looked like she was suicidal .
you , too . happy tossing and turning .
no , it 's getting worse .
carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed --
close quarters combat . keep one in my own home .
i 'm just sayin ' -- it was a steep hillside . there was no moon that night ...
see what i mean ? wearing bloomin ' uniforms n ' all .
those aren 't guards . they 're valets .
faith .
you steady on , man . what the fuck else did you do back there .
hard to miss .
i can never decide what i like better . leaving home , or coming back .
where else ?
i doubt it .
yeah . i know her , all right . she came down here once , stirred up a shitstorm . we lost a full day 's work , took me weeks to get back on schedule . if she hadn 't a ' been terry 's woman i would 've broke her jaw . 'course , she 's nobody 's problem now .
what do you think ?
listen , get the fuck out of here before you get hurt . who the fuck do you think you are , waltzing in here , asking questions ?
be seein ' you .
ann . will you come in ?
please , mr crane , it 's ok , please --
no . uh ... family friend .
well ? how 'd she do ?
what is it , dave ?
come on in .
nah , don 't say anything . i 'm alright .
i tried to tell him the whole story , but riedenschneider stopped me . he said the story made his head hurt , and anyway he didn 't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave ...
yeah , yeah -- go home .
huh ? no .
he 's the dead guy .
hello , walter .
well , have you ever considered tar macadam ? people think it 's just for public works and commercial purposes , roads , parking lots , so forth ...
calm down . i found it !
let 's go !
eight to the right ! look ! i found it !
like hell !
if you don 't mind a suggestion , you might try a saliva test .
i 'm one of the few who know every inch it , now that john is gone .
there 's a dead body in the exhibit ! people are panicking , trampling each other trying to get out .
i know .
all right everybody , hold up !
it 's one of the fire doors . good lord , margo . we 're trapped !
no , dr. frock . you can 't .
look who 's here , margo .
yes . john made quite a study of the whole museum . he had a copy of my original plans .
footsteps !

another storage room .
i 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings , but you know me . telegraph . telephone . tell kawakita . i got the definitive word from cuthbert 's secretary . this is dr. frock 's last week .
yes , he 's fine . greg ... take care of yourself !
no . the planetarium is in the next cell . this is one of the fire doors ...
what are you going to do ?
it 's scared of me .
oh god ! help !
it 's coming . run .
no , hold back ...
he was tidying up his garbage . i was going to call you . but half-way through , he gave up and fell asleep .
do it !
i 'm the creator .
truman ? it 's me , marlon . i need to talk to you .
it 's a surprise .
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw . we got three of his fingers back on .
what ? !
you can count on it .
yeah .
what do i do . i 'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade . an annoyance to my superiors . a joke among my peers . `` spooky , '' they call me . spooky mulder . whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid . who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens and anyone who 'll listen that the fix is in . that our government 's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy . that the sky is falling and when it hits it 's gon na be the shitstorm of all time .
technically and biologically , though he 'll never recover .
the developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . we 've just slowed the process .
strughold . he 's just gotten on a plane in tunis .
standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding .
no . i 've been watching your career for a good while . back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that .
you can 't .
what happened to playing a hunch ?
the element of surprise , scully . random acts of unpredictability . if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities , we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that can not be programmed , categorized or easily referenced ...
it 's locked ?
hang on . i 'm gon na get you out of there .
-- mulder ! get in the car !
there 's some kind of cellular breakdown . it 's completely edematous .
i don 't know why i think they went right .
come on !
i don 't know .
salt lake city , utah . transfer effective immediately .
i think ... something stung me .
where 's scully ? !
i 'm not taking any chances .
i 've got to find scully .
we 've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves .
lucien baines ?
what happened ?
carl , do you know ? like on a map ...
i can 't leave him !
give her a minute . hello , valentine .
absolutely . abigail ...
all yours . my boss says it 's one of the strangest requests the bureau 's ever had .
i got it .
he 's beautiful ...
's broken .
initiating connection .
yes .
yes . but you 're going to sit down right now . i have to ...
pregnant . thanks for asking .
damn , man , i give up . your partner tells you his wife 's gon na have a baby , and all you care about is a coroner 's report !
das mussen sie doch wissen . ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins hans komme fraulein schmidt , ein schande ...
they think you did it .
i know . i wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident .
the police . they 're searching my room . sie mussen doch wissen .
well you read this .

he told you , didn 't he ?
there isn 't enough for two laughs .

from kurtz . they have just been arrested . but harry won 't come , he 's not a fool .
entschuldigen sie . it was a terrible thing .
yes .
i have never seen him .
what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down .
this is forgery . it is very clever .
can i have that woman 's passport ?
fellow called lime .
calloway - i 'm english , not irish .
going to find me the real criminal ? it sounds like one of your stories .
you 're not locking her up ?
i would like a word with this orderly harbin .
it 's more like a mortuary than police headquarters .
thank you . excuse me .
she 's right . it 's none of my business .
you all did .
two thirty .
i haven 't got a sensible name , calloway .
i 'm so glad to have met you , sir . i 've read quite a few of your books .
you know , paine 's one of your devoted readers . he 's promised ...
i 'd like to visit texas one day , sir .
yes , cultural re-education section propaganda . very important in a place like this . we do a little show each week . last week we did `` hamlet '' and the week before we had something ...
nonsense . your novels are very popular here . aren 't they , sergeant ?
it is , and i 'm gunning just the same way for your major callaghan .
oh , i thought you would know , you 're a writer . of course you do . good night , old man .
oh , that is mr. martins ' little joke , of course ...
yes , hindu dances , thank you , sergeant . this is the first opportunity we 've had of making an american author welcome .
very popular . are you staying long ?
excuse me , have you got tooth ...
what do you want ?
at the end of every chapter --
what did he say ?
only his doctor , dr. winkel .
i live in the russian sector , but you 'll find me at the casanova club every night . one has to work ...
but you will .
how do you do .
all right - i 'm mad . i 've seen a ghost ...
english ?
who ?
must be some mistake .
yes , sir .
who else ?
i am not a bad man .
not the sort of thing i should confess to a total stranger , but you have to break the rules sometimes . humanity 's duty .
what else ?
a novel , mr. martins ?
not when i get interested .
yes .
never .
oh .
what happened ?
fuck off .
one night i will get the perfect photograph .
if it 's too far , then we 'll drown . but if we dont try then we 'll never know .
where did you lose it ?
i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt . moriah , and we still live in terror ... .
he 's an asshole .
we 'll go to the country sometime , okay ?
danny , it 's true . there were no six million . at most , two hundred thousand jews died in the camps . and the majority of them were from disease and --
at first , no one will know why the victims are being killed .
you want it to be an event .
you can 't .
he 's at a home out here .
i stole it . from a synagogue .
who 's eichmann ? ! ! ?
i 'm stealing it .
he 's jewish ? manzetti ?
no .
the arguments , anyway .
i just came to get some stuff . i 'll be out in five minutes . he doesn 't want me around .
number ten .
her place is down the road . but she just comes out for weekends sometimes .
green dot -- shotgun powder . for pipe bombs . a guy in a lumberyard gave it to me . a donation to the cause .
here ...
i 'm not hungry ... . come on , let 's drive around ... . we don 't want to be spotted here .
yeah , hey , how 're you doing ...
four . but no one this important .
do i give a shit ?
obviously .
danny , please , we don 't want to know .
as you know , cindy , thirteen is a mystical number in the jewish faith . we believe that god has thirteen attributes ...
johana cross , pleased to meet you . well ! isn 't this a coincidence . i really wasn 't expecting this ... all the way out here . it 's incredible !
no , it 's the recipe for spaghetti `` frutti del mare '' . you see i was right in getting you out here . you 're a world champion , my friend !
enzo !
six seconds .
very chic . anyway , you don 't have anything else , do you ?
eh ? si ! avanti !
`` that '' ! this is not a `` that '' ...
he 's training .
i 'm sorry ... i don 't know how to ask the questions .
no problem , i enjoy talking in my sleep .
so what ! ? his job is to hand out the paychecks . and he does that very well , let me tell you .
thank you , thank you very much !
enzo , don 't be angry . i was lucky ... that 's all .
we can 't dive anymore . they want to cancel the competition for a while .
thank you . i wouldn 't want to interrupt anything .
no ? huh ? yes , of course ! !
i 'm putting you on the coin ... your essence ... that way you 'll always be with me when i dive .
you go back , i 'll walk .
no , no . it 's true . when i was in new york , oh boy ! before my accident , you understand ?
oh jesus ... ! i 'll make some coffee . they left the stove .
his mother 's an american . he spent half of his life in the states . i 'd try english if i were you .
... yes ?
he must be behind that curtain . relax . we 're undercover . we need to give off the appearance of calm . you see esther , the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in . act as a gentile would .
yeah , no kidding .
now we wait for santa to make his next move .
sure . why not .
i said , do you come here often ! ?
i 'm sorry esther , i just don 't think we can see each other romantically anymore .
we go to the same temple .
what a good poop you made in your diaper mazel tov ! that 's right ! mommy loves you ! such a good boy you are !
happy hanukkah morty .
yeah , i 'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on sunday . i have a terrible yeast infection and i need to see my gynecologist .
he 's still working out some identity issues .
just praying to god that we don 't kill ourselves going over this wall .
the alarm will trigger if the system detects any non-w.a.s.p . tendencies inside the building . for example , if you were to dribble a basketball , or eat watermelon , or use the word dawg ... that is , spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o ... within the confines of this workshop , the alarm would sound .
offscreen gunfire . that jewish atomic clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget .
everything 's kosher . watch him for me .
i 'm just calming the kiddies . there 's no need to worry about santa . he 's just having a peaceful , adult conversation with his nice jewish friend , the hebrew hammer .
i don 't have to tell you anything hammer ! you 're gon na have to kill me before i tell you !
oh , that 's the beauty of it . these are free samples .
it was good . very chilling , but you still got all the points across that we talked about .
it 's friday .
up at the museum .
but he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl .
where ? where did you find it ?
let me see it
maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
tomorrow -
yes . it 's always fascinated me . you know , once , when i was a youngster , i went to see mrs. leslie carter in `` zaza . '' after the play i stood in the alley just to watch her come out .
we 're old friends .
it could be . why would a man kill her ? for what ? it wasn 't robbery . it wasn 't a crime of jealousy or passion . she had no enemies .
there 's a little museum here in town . they 've hired me to run it , we 've some interesting exhibits of indian arts and crafts . it 's fun -- and i like living here in new mexico .
nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time .
professional hunters , who rid the state of cougars .
now look what you 've done .
you remember the fellow this morning -- galbraith . you 've got time before the supper show .
do they close up every year for this processionist business ?
what ... some kind of organ factory ... pregnant girls doped up . babies . theres a lot of people back there . theyre holding a seminar . traffickings the past , breeding the future ...
thats right . wheres the fucking italian , eh , mr french hero ?

may i ask if you are jewish , mr lombard ?
we conclude our transaction .
does it matter ?
look , i dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here , mister . whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you . why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner , eh ?
shut up and drive !
the ladys not a friend . shes a whore . someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london . and not just movies .
un autrichien . negociant en pr- pubescents .
shut up and walk ...
how dare you stop me doing god 's will !
they 've started the battle without me !
jeanne , no ...
not yet !
performing a miracle .
for the sake of france , charles . and for the sake of my grandson .
we 're taking back the tourelles !
no good ? this is a disaster !
won ? ! such a small word will never do ! this is victory , jeanne , this is ... glory !
good . but `` love your enemies '' ... body and soul .
yes .
dead .
christmas . this is not a good time to have children . but then ...
what are you doing ?
doesn 't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ? where will we get them ?
what , i 'm working , what ?
sit down , have tea , i 'll start lunch when the girls get back .
your work , yes , playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto , they don 't give a damn about people 's sufferings , they don 't even notice what 's going on around them !
'if you prick us , do we not bleed ? if you tickle us , do we not laugh ? if you poison us , do we not die ? and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ? '
yes , that 's why i brought it .
the russians . on the other side of the river . all you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks .
we 're getting out .
not yet .
watch your feet !
watch his hand
she 's stunted , that 's one thing .
ada says you 're doing well with the piano ?
they are washed .
the marks do not come out . they are scars and hardened skin .
yes and so do i , but there are too few of us here to carry it . too - heavy
let us not discuss this further . i am very pleased ... .
hello .
on your piano , that is the swap .
at the finish , it 's single action by two , fasanella second , visitation third . line on single action ... 3 to 2 . hell with it , that 's no good .
well we got some workin ' money anyway .
yeh , it was easy .
if we 're lucky , this 'll bring him back stronger than ever .
he wants to put a half million on syphon .
nothin ' yet . i got a good one on the lead at hialeah , but he 's fadin ' .
pass .
raise 500 .
raise 5,000 .
then you 'll have to come up with another grand somewhere .
he 'd like to kill me .
yeh , this time anyway .
had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th . she got me with her ring .
sorry . don 't know a thing .
i 'm sorry .
he 's just around the corner .
help yourself . oh , tom , show this gentleman ...
nothing .
hello , there !
no . the lawyer -- i 'm going to see him .
i 've got to see you alone !
hello , nick ! and a party - celebrating father 's third murder -
he 's all right .
so you say - go on , bob .
it 's a bargain then . anything you want to know ?
yeah . couldn 't find a thing . this is the way we figure it . wynant goes to julia 's apartment . he finds morelli there ... sees she 's two- timing him . they have a fight . but he figures he don 't want to do anything then ... . morelli might squeal . so he goes away . he don 't let his lawyer know anything has happened ... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him , so that julia will think it 's all blown over . then , when she don 't expect it ... he lets her have it .
she 's ready to talk . it won 't do any harm , though - to find out where he is .
i 'll take care of him .
you see , he 'd been very clever . everybody , even our astute friend guild , thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer . but our hero had just one weak link in his chain . the telegrams , wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant . so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case . mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is . mimi , who was it that told you to say you 'd seen wynant ?
that 's nothing . i saw him myself .
let him have his say out .
good morning , lieutenant - sorry .
i don 't mind telling you i 'd rather have you working with us than against us .
marian ! marian ! don 't go ! i 'll behave ! i 'll do anything ! don 't go , marian !
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you ?
gilbert ! is he here too ? we might as well be living in the lobby .
and the murderer is right here in this room tonight ... he 's sitting at this table . you may serve the fish .
this is your party .
that last martini .
santa claus .
yes . i know all they know about the murder . and i 'm a great hero . the tribune said i was shot twice .
i wouldn 't know . that time he caught me was a accident . i led with my right .
help , i 'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory .
low on gas . got to refill .
all right . i 'll go up , then you send up the gold and --
i told you . he tried to steal our gold . he tried to kill us .
i told you ; don 't push me around .
if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
i did it ! i got the box open .
yeah , that 's exactly what i think . you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes . let 's get out of here . we got sand to protect .
roger that .
i steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !
i got that ... sir .
mine .
epps ...
it 's the treasure , that 's what it is .
shut up and listen !
if they land , we can take them . if they don 't land , then we 've got nothing to worry about .
so where do we start ?
i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that 's where the light comes from . couldn 't see it with the lanternon .
okay . then we go this way .
i don 't have a weapon .
i don 't know . he didn 't have a uniform on . he ... he had on white robes , like the guys who killed wes .
we can 't stay here . even if that wasn 't an iraqi soldier it 's only a matter of time before some show up . get all the water you can carry , and we 'll head out on foot .
sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we 'll know we 're heading towards saudi arabia .
we keep going , that 's what we do . we ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
you were shot . we were standing right there , you were shot !
no , but i figure now 's a real good time to start .
he 's going to slow down .
i thought it would be good to know .
we make it , or we go back empty handed .
lines up with the map and the photos .
guess we know what the next stop is .
no , evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel . secure another sinex drop .
well it 's fixed , so you 'll have to eat it .
don 't be so sure .
i don 't know .
ah ugh .
a shelldweller . they live in the outer shell of the city . quite unique , there have been two here before . they smell .
what ?
that way .
look more closely .
no ?
we just got a bomb threat upstairs .
no thanks , bev .
you the bomb squad ?
off a girl 's wrist . a suspect ...
that cop who bought it ... you didn 't tell us he was your partner .
no you 're not , you just don 't understand them . here , do what i tell you .
congratulations , you just built your first ticker .
close your eyes , feel your fingertips . tell me everything you feel .
stay to your left .
we work fast enough for you ?
nothing . maybe they gave up , split town .
helluva fuck factor .
unlikely . probably , cash register or something .
i was wrong ... this didn 't come from any cash register .
a bowling alley .
meg 's lasagna . good eats , reilly . c'mon .
people are dying .
security .
nothing ... just tired .
we 're moving ' on . i have to pick up the supplies . just two little boxes .
shut up ! who is this ?
take him !
a ticking bomb ...
and what , you 'll shoot me ? hey , don 't mistake me for one of your partners , i 'd like to make retirement in one piece .
look , it 's important .
still waiting for a miracle . go ahead .
that 'd be some explosive pussy he 's got his hands on .
fuck factor ten .
yeah , just a nick ...
ain 't that a shit --
quiet !
it 's about this .
captain assigned me to assist you .
ira - instant retirement account .
that feeling won 't last long .
a man in love , completely shaken . he sits on bed , thinks , then takes telephone slowly , decisively .
good morning . i'd-i'd-i 'd like to look at some cuff links .
i 'm crazy about you . by the way , your pin .
how much is your salary ?
an hour , two at most .
so do i .
there are still some boats forward . stay with this one ... murdoch . he seems to be quite ... practical .
i put the diamond in my coat pocket . and i put my coat ... on her .
that 's right . two things dear to me have disappeared this evening . now that one is back ... ... i have a pretty good idea where to find the other . search him .
can i bum a cigarette ?
of course not . that 's not the point . goodbye ! goodbye ! ! i 'll miss you !
i don 't know what she 's say , she don 't know what i say , so we get along fine .
we got ta get up there or we 're gon na be gargling saltwater . where 's tommy ?
freezing . maybe a couple degrees over .
pleased to meet you , mr. dawson .
i 've got you . i won 't let go .

time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin .
to the stars .
au contraire , mon cher .
it 's okay . i 'm alright .
cal , you can 't be serious ! we 're in the middle of an emergency and you --
we 'll find out .
just a few more minutes . it 'll take them a while to get the boats organized ...
if your grandma is who she says she is , she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank . and that makes you my new best friend . i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery .
we were pissin ' in the wind the whole time .
yes . very nice . have you met my granddaughter , lizzy ? she takes care of me .
you had it the entire time ? !
glad to see you again .
that 's a date .
well , it 'll have to be poker -- but i 'm so unlucky in that game .
and me coming in with two pair --
that depends on how mother 's feeling . you 'll excuse me , gentlemen ?
i agree with you -- no gentleman , would -- but i would -- -- especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards .
want to take it back ?
good night , idiot !
yes , sir ! -- i will , sir -- certainly , sir !
looks like he 's taking a trip -- see the baggage ? the only time they ever picked me up , mckinney walked through the room while they were grilling -- let 's see how good his memory is .
see you later , shortie -- i 'm off to the pool .
hope i didn 't keep you waiting .
it 's a pleasure .
much better -- thank you --
make it three , boys -- i 'll play this hand pat .

good-bye , mister bond .
take the girl . leave the handcuffs . we 'll drown her at sea .
get them out of here . if he says one word , shoot him .

it 's on the boat . he 's holding a press conference tomorrow .
occasionally , yes . british media mogul . born in hong kong ; controls newspapers , tv , radio , cable , satellites ; books , magazines , movies , computer software . theme parks .
well ... if you insist .
that 's reassuring .
jack wade . citibank . commercial loan division . if you 're ever lookin ' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
i 'm not certain ... but i think there 's someone i want to press for some answers in kuala lumpur .
depends what number you write .
i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat .
no . i 'm going with you .
what do you mean ?
don 't say it .
next time , i do the driving .
it seems , 007 , we 've received a tip
actually , you 're just in time . admiral roebuck : you know commander bond , don 't you ?
captain morton .
seems to be back to normal , sir .
i see you two have met .
my timing always was lousy .
don 't worry . mr . bond will get the message . so will his boss .
... but because i am a just man , i 've decided to give mr. hussein what he deserves .

we 're gon na get outta here , buzz -- buzz ?
speed up !
excuse me .
let me in .
all the time .
you 're late for breakfast .
it 's very hard for me to come and tell you this .
what are you thinking , calling me at home with a message like that ? you 've compromised me and our relationship --
drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . canada is completely overwhelmed .
she 'll be at a pawn shop in an hour .
honey , your father knows the president .
i keep feeling like i 'm forgetting something .
just watch .
it 's a funny fuckin ' joke and it 's quick . why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
i don 't know .
agents who died in the field .
no . on you go .
i 'm off for a pish . when i come back , that money 's still here , ok ?
no problem . no problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood .
you doubt me ?
perhaps `` because it is there '' is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain .
i am preparing to toast a marsh melon .
goodnight , doctor .
yes .
an eternity during which we 'll be vulnerable to klingon attack . korrd-you tell him .
mark two . request emergency assistance . acknowledge .
it 's all right , captain . proceed .
i believe we are witnessing my birth .
you staged all this to get your hands on my ship ?
in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible , we 're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually .
of course . of course . then i 'll take the ship without your help .
no . you must kill me .
hi , flynn .
frustrating . i had tron almost ready to run , and dillinger cut everybody with group 7 access out of the system .
so ... nice ship you got here . what 's our next move ?
oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they 'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i don 't think you
tanks ... coming back . let 's go .
i 'm sorry , tron ... he 's ... he didn 't make it .
yes .
it 's too far !
recognizers !
alan-one ...
little more juice 's all it needs ...
that 's right . he pushed me ... in the other world . somebody pushes me , i push back . so i brought him down here ... what 's the matter , sark ? you look nervous .
then pull yourself together . get this clown trained . i want him in the games until he dies playing .
do it !
oh , tron ... i knew you 'd escape ... they 've never built circuit that could hold you ...
fine .
in the helicopter .
what ?
here , check these out .
what ?
uh huh . want me to lose them ?
gon na try to get a closer shot of * beavis & butthead . *
and make it fast . my horse is getting tired .
hardcore , highly fanatical , ultra- * fundamentalist . linked to * numerous car-bombings , that cafe * bomb in rome , and the 727 out of lisbon last year . major player . *
you didn 't have sexual relations with him ?
it 's show time . don 't look at * the flash . do not look at the flash .
sorry .
juno . i wish i could say it 's a pleasure to see you again .
me too .
yeah , it was wild .
three days later , he called me . he told me to meet him at overlook park .
you wouldn 't believe me .
don 't call me honey ! you don 't ever get to call me honey again . you understand ? ! you pig !
wait here . if you have to use this , use it . don 't choke . okay ?
some kinda legal secretary of something . married to some boring jerk .
no . soon as i turn you 'll shoot me .
go ahead .
fuck you .
you recognized my style . see , you 're very good . you 're a natural at this .
it 's serious . that 's all i can * say . just meet on k street under * the key bridge . at eight sharp . *
nope .
he wants to speak with you .
yeah . i got elbowed right in the eye . and if that wasn 't enough , i got hurled the ball when i 'm not looking . wam ! right in my face .
the letter he sent .
that 's a `` rookies '' doll . george sanford brown . we got ta lotta dolls . they 're real cool . did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in `` the black hole '' ? i always found it funny somewhere there 's a kid playin ' with a little figure of earnest borgnine .
he was just born , remember ? this is the first one . you know that guy , dr. gene scott ? he said that the story of spiderman is the story of christ , just disguised . well , i thought about that even before i heard him say it . hold on , let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time .
thank you .
in fact , i 'm gon na show you what i mean with a little demonstration . big d , toss me that shotgun .
fuck you ! my mother was apache .
has he gotten his mail today ?
now tell him goodbye .
no , i don 't really mean it . well , i mean , this is our last chance to think about it . how 'bout you , bama ?
no thanks , my stomach 's a little upset . i ate somethin ' at a restaurant that made me a little sick .
mr. donowitz ? i told you , through dick . he 's in my acting class . about a year . yeah , he 's good . they grew up together . sure thing .
they 'll be along .
actually , they can count it . i 'd like to use the little boy 's room .
it 's a fact . sicilians have nigger blood pumpin ' through their hearts . if you don 't believe me , look it up . you see , hundreds and hundreds of years ago the moors conquered sicily . and moors are niggers . way back then , sicilians were like the wops in northern italy . blond hair , blue eyes . but , once the moors moved in there , they changed the whole country . they did so much fuckin ' with the sicilian women , they changed the blood-line for ever , from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin . i find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day , hundreds of years later , sicilians still carry that nigger gene . i 'm just quotin ' history . it 's a fact . it 's written . your ancestors were niggers . your great , great , great , great , great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger , and had a half-nigger kid . that is a fact . now tell me , am i lyin ' ?
look here . if i ever did eat some pussy - i would never eat any pussy - but , if i did eat some pussy , i sure as hell wouldn 't tell no goddamn body . i 'd be ashamed as a motherfucker .
uh , i didn 't hear the ...
we have a very advanced program , something very different , requires very skilled people .
what are you going to do with us ?
uh , no . yes . i mean , just some scrapes ...
jeffrey mason ?
you have to give yourself up , you know .
so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music . so we can appreciate what we have while we have it . forgive me , psychiatrists don 't cry .
in the 18th century there was no such thing ! nobody 'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway . along comes this doctor ... semmelweiss , i think . he tries to convince people ... other doctors mostly ... that there are these teeny tiny invisible `` bad things '' called germs that get into your body and make you ... sick ! he 's trying to get doctors to wash their hands . what is this guy ... crazy ? teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em ? ... `` germs '' !
not as bad as what they 're doing to kitty .
then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated , fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent , replaced the grill behind him and that he 's wriggling through the ventilation system right now ?
were you listening ? we got two officers in the hospital . yeah , he 's in restraints , plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse . look at him ! still on his feet .
things ain 't always the way they seem . you got to ask yourself ; is it worth it ?
flo , i 'm just gon na help myself to a refill on the coffee .
thank you .
after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .
we 're going all the way . together .
grace ! just . . . let me handle this . sheriff , i 'm telling you there 's nothing in that trunk . if that 's not good enough for you , then i 'd be happy to open it . just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant .
because i 'm sick and tired of her little games . because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again . because i 've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her , and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it .
i said come on !
no !
you came to take my wife from me ?
don 't jake me boy ! it 's a big house . you probably didn 't even make it out to the desert this afternoon ...
what 's the matter ? the fight gone out of you ? i 'm just gon na smash a headlight . maybe two .
no ! no police .
thank you .
after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .
it should be just up ahead . hold on ... there ! there it is !
but we all need that too . hold him .
'cause i love you .
and love 's a funny thing . sometimes i don 't know if i want to love you ...
son . little excitement out at the reservation this morning . wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun . bia handled it . i went by for backup .
flo , i 'm just gon na help myself to a refill on the coffee .
hell , no . that wayne can 't shoot when he 's sober , much less drunk . he 's lucky he didn 't kill his own danged self . well , anyhow , you stay cool . nice meeting you , son .
i picked them out for you , jake . i thought you would like the colors .
i said come on !
yes .
you 've made a considerably wise decision .
i was hoping you would call me , but ... anyway i decided not to wait . i was thinking , it might be nice to go to dinner together .
i don 't know for sure . ... i don 't think so .
one last question .
no . and i have been sick . i spent a week in a hospital when i was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning . two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool . they were dunking me . i swallowed water . they didn 't know it and they almost killed me . heroes don 't get killed like that . normal people do .

oh yes . she thinks you like policing because you think you 're right about everything . and you 're the only one who can do anything . and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a ... um ... bag of elbows .

trying to change the past . he said it was the only way to save the world --
i don 't think she 's coming with us .
what 's with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you 're `` extreme '' ? i 've got some news for you , mr. x , you 're a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x 's on your head .
crude and defiant as always , triple x . it fits so well because you 're obscene .
just remember , i 'll be watching .
i 'm an information gatherer . you wan na go somewhere and talk about it ?
let me guess , they had a big white torpedo with them .
he owns a big industrial complex on the river . he 'll launch it from there .

this is a gift . from me to you .
don 't forget goatee boy . i greased him up on the diamond run .
the neuro-filter acts like a surge protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor 's mind . it 's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions .
his vital signs are weak and getting weaker .
no . i 'm ... i don 't know if we can do this without charles .
i 'm sorry . i 'm not strong enough .
suit yourself .
senator ?
intention ? intention , senator ? we are talking about mankind here . his fear . it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps . studied for weaknesses . and eventually wiped off the face of the earth .
you 're backstage at the encore of creation .
this . this whole god damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of `` team '' of super-powered freaks . teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . for what ?
alive .
yes , sir .
he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me i did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being .
goodbye , darling !

good night !
and i have mine .
