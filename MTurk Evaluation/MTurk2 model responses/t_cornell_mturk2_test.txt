i can whip your ass .
yeah .
he 's moving to the big city next week . he wants to be a metal singer .
no , sir .
but you know what ? nothing matters , anyway . we are insignificant out here in the big nowhere , say the badass sociopath in my backseat . right ? yeah . that 's one thing i 've got to thank you for , bro . and i never saw it that way ...
she 's got him ! you hear that ?
look at the bottom of the screen . you see the icon with the arrow pointing left ? click on that ... twice .
show what ? it 's gone . he wrote a self destruct virus into the code , so it would only play until we try to copy it . then it erased itself . gone ... do you remember what you saw ?
yes .
you , too . kick ass today .
tonight .
oh , yeah ... probably ...
shut up !
thanks .
i read about them in time magazine . when these revolutionary brothers and sisters are free , the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the los angeles international airport where you will be given further instructions . you have two hours to comply .
yes ! i 've dreamed of it for years , but your movie made me realize i 've got to take action . goodbye , penis !
absolutely ! it 's just the beginning . i promise this : if we stick together , one day i 'll make every single one of you famous .
you bet .
take as much room as you want
i never carry ... baggage .
he 's got a reputation for doing all his --
that 's it except for the first . we got the sheraton , the ambassador , or the holiday inn on sixtieth . all three-day turns .
i 'm afraid i have to insist you leave .
who is this guy , anyway ?
are you thinking what i 'm thinking ?
i need a vacation .
hi , tita .

yeah , give me a minute .
she is beautiful .
you 're walkin ' bitch , will 's takin ' the car .
drive carefully .
this condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do . hey kids , make your parents and teachers feel like shit ! get the respect in death you 'll never get in life .
i 'm the matron 's favourite patient and she 's shown me her special stitch !
don 't worry , gina ! mummy and daddy love each other .
that 's okay . i love you anyway .
what are you doing ? ! stop that !
we wait until 7:00 . if he is not here with the twins he is not coming . we leave . that was your promise . go help the children .
if this is someone 's idea of a joke --
very good . well , i think i can say with complete honesty : i 've never heard of any of you .
what !
guards come exactly every three minutes ... .
see , it 's not a macho thing . it 's about equilibrium in your inner ear . you could 've used a patch , but it 's too late now . get used to it . some folks just can 't sail .
well , i had a car , and it was right here . i guess somebody moved it .
sure i know where he lives . he lives in bailey park .

i 'm not ready !
always .
i knew she had it .
just keep me covered .
maybe he 's hungry .
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me ...
... cigars in bed ? i broke him on that . but the bathroom 's a swamp , he wears reeboks to dinner , tells the same , admittedly funny , jokes three hundred times ...
i 'll just be in here .
no . just riviera trying to fuck with our heads . they 're close . very close .
i-i-i-i-i d-d-don 't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does .
mister washington .
in that case ... no ...
i started them golden warriors . i was their first supreme commander .
i thought i felt mean tonight . but i 'm not i 'm just all mixed up ... .

not just this minute , j.j ... .
listen . understand . that terminator is out there . it can 't be reasoned with , it can 't be bargained with ... it doesn 't feel pity of remorse or fear ... and it absolutely will not stop . ever . until you are dead .
wanted to wish you luck . not that you 'll need it .
be seein ' you .
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw . we got three of his fingers back on .

just praying to god that we don 't kill ourselves going over this wall .
spitz . we spoke on the telephone . my husband ... my daughter , deborah , whose house this is . my son-in-law , carlos ... the gentleman is a business partner of his .
let us not discuss this further . i am very pleased ... .
you see , he 'd been very clever . everybody , even our astute friend guild , thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer . but our hero had just one weak link in his chain . the telegrams , wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant . so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case . mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is . mimi , who was it that told you to say you 'd seen wynant ?
yes . i know all they know about the murder . and i 'm a great hero . the tribune said i was shot twice .
shut up and listen !
one to seven : deal the face cards .

gon na try to get a closer shot of * beavis & butthead . *
hardcore , highly fanatical , ultra- * fundamentalist . linked to * numerous car-bombings , that cafe * bomb in rome , and the 727 out of lisbon last year . major player . *
after dark . i 'll leave the back door unlocked .

and she died ...
oh really ? starbucks ?

i can see that .
there 's a lot i haven 't done with a man before .
sorry .

*homer* liked it ! didn 't you ?
no trouble .
we 're not cops .
i don 't know . i packed up my shit and ran away . to this ... so unlike you , i guess i do have something to prove , in a repressed anger sort of way .
there is no scam ! i 've got a fucking sign on my back ! i can 't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money . you get it ? it 's over . we walk .
logan cale .

c'mon guys --
amazing you made it this far .
be careful , francie .
she 'll never be yours ! she said my name ! she remembers !
i have no idea .
well , general , i think i ain 't got no school learning , i ain 't got no trade ... and i 'm a drunk . so , i think there ain 't much left to be set free .
that 's just my interpretation . actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners . you see ? walk in a gently 'z ' . there are four distinct movements ...
nobody 's seen anything like this . lions don 't have caves like this- -they 're doing it for pleasure .
i knew that .
there 's something very familiar about this painting .
why ? then they 'll notice when i 'm gone . well . i 'm making a public appearance aren 't i ?
i don 't know . they must think i look like this guy gladstone .
no problem . my husband gets up the crack of dawn . it 's his kidneys .
broken blood vessels on her right forearm .
shit , beth , why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin ' fair ? it 's only halloween .
oh .
oh yeah ? on your own a lot , huh ?
oh , pardon me . i obviously didn 't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value . no , you talk to me . but -- do me a favor ? -- none of this demons crap .
why don 't you fellows get your own news ?
it doesn 't have to rhyme !
you know you did !
what 's the use ? i can 't win a pot .

the back door was open .
dad , we 're well out of range .
much better now , thank you . just sit here quietly ... see there 's nothing to worry about ... just be my old self again ... .soon ...
whoever took it does .
in his inside coat pocket .
you went out this morning and bought a gun ?
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older .
you 're crazy !
be reasonable , boys -- this isn 't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish . ben ... do you have all the pictures you need ?
the party ?
fuck off !
call dispatch . double the patrols . i want that area blanketed .
`` is '' . did you tell him about the institute ?
it bodes evil .
and you thought they might be under her dress ?
the game was to make me smaller than he was . no matter what . he could be almost invisible as a human being , but i had to be smaller . so if i got good grades , i was a pussy for not playing football . if i cut my hair for him , it wasn 't short enough . if i shaved it , i looked like a psycho . i never won the game . not once . and if he couldn 't make me smaller with words ...
sooner than the fall .
either do you .
sorry ... i ...
well , there 's nothing we can do until the morning .
all right , i will ! i 'll let my hair down ! why not ? it can 't make any real difference now . hey lovey , were you ever chased by the police ?
i 'm just warning you , i can 't swim .
please make way , please --
jesus christ , no . okay , okay . you got it , you got it ! you 're the boss .
well , at the time she told me this , she already had six . every time i saw the woman , she was either ...
the painless pole plans to cross the great divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out .
feller runs the chronicle . here 's the speech you makeand it 's all written out for you .
i said , sir -- in my official capacity -- as an honorary gesture -- i appoint you to the united states senate !
uh-huh .
you 'll excuse me , won 't you ? i 'll be right back .
sounds familiar .

i thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
ssh ...
while you eat , you look at the view .
i 'm going , leon ... but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown , madame yakushova . is that what they 're wearing in moscow this year ?
i don 't know . will there ?
to kill your wife .
don 't know , delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin ' for their lack of sight , even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers . now clearly , seein ' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery . it 's not so surprising , then , if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
the hell you say ! wash is kin !
i haven 't made up my mind .
you 're the worst of that sort . you 're the sort that gives that sort a bad name .
indeed .
i can 't go out there . how can i go out there ?
i think you have a call ?

who 's fighting ? this is the test , man . it 's a crazy game .
provisions ! we are not leaving that motel room again till after new year 's : we need ten days worth of provisions ! what 's good ? !
buffet is by the goddamn bar ! what the hell kind of map is this ? !
was he all pissed off ?
i tried that once , it don 't work . you get four guys fighting over who 's gon na be mr. black . since nobody knows anybody else , nobody wants to back down . so forget it , i pick . be thankful you 're not mr. yellow .
the whole state 's lookin ' for 'em . and they 're lookin ' for me .
no i 'm not , you mother-fucker !
i 'm a bad girl . i 'm a bad girl .

animal ! animal ! aren 't you ashamed of yourself ? a couple of guys are trying to escape and you 're thinking of broads . broads ?
he 's the grrrrreatest !
it adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy . because i 'm telling you . the krauts wouldn 't plant two stoolies in one barrack . and whatever you do to me you 're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy .
the station complement was nineteen .
execute !
yes , sir .
i demand to see the owners ! i demand --
they should be quarantined before joining the ship 's population .
prepare to enter the atmosphere ... we 'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him ...
what ?
very much .
how did you find out ?
okay then , you 're crazy .
wish i could say the same thing .
we 'll make our own fog .
from the municipal council -- they 're the bodies of paupers --
that 's a good boy , toddy .
that 's exactly what this place is . one great big coffin . let 's stake 'em .
move it , palmer .
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb .
toy poodle !
i wish .
hey , just 'cause you 're no good with a rope ...
no further questions .
`` painted '' ?
it 's completely done on a contingency basis . that means whatever the settlement is i retain one-third ... that is , of course , the usual arrangement ...
but you 're not going to . you 're not the kind . you 're tired , anyway . you 've been up all night . you cracked up in a plane . slept in a ditch . but you want to know something ? it doesn 't show on you at all .
they wouldn 't let me ...
it was an act of god for christ 's sake .
who then ?
and that 's what i say , too . we could have all been killed .
i 'll look in here again .
every morning .
gear ! come on , girls , let 's have a bit of a dance .
they can always grab oranges off trees . this you can 't do in times square ...
... among so many quiet qualities .
whatever .
you think so ?
how ?
what 's that ?
shut the fuck up .
i ... i didn 't think you would ... i 'm sorry ... i believed that son-of-a- bitch ...
things my hear used to know things it years to remember
and how 's the diva doing ?
whatever , do you remember ? i 've seen all your movies . when i was in rehab , the second time , they wouldn 't even let us see your drug addict movie . they said you were too real . i worship you . and i couldn 't be more flattered , because i know the part i 'm playing in joe 's movie is based on you as a young woman .
157 continued :
that plane might 've been to throw us off the track . remember the bait-and-switch wilder pulled with the eskimo and his truck ?
so am i , frank .
home , school , here ...
let me ask you something , bruce . what is man 's greatest tool ?
it 's okay . there 's no one out here . just open the door . trust me .
yeah , heh heh . let 's just wheel this thing back to the house .
you mean there 's mre than one ?
damn ! where the hell is he ? we should 've found him by now .

i know you say to take the arizona offer , but my husband needs more recognition . _ 25 .
and say what ? `` please remove your dick from my ass ? ! ''
the bones will be there when we get back . that 's the nice thing about them . they never run away . and besides , you got me into this . i don 't intend to be alone with these people .

anyone with taste , anyone with breeding ... . a gentleman , would choose british racing green , with maybe a tan interior ... but when you buy a red car , with a black interior and wire wheels , you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and i 'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is ... in front of the children .
i 'm not upset . i will never play with those girls . i only surround myself with people who i find intellectually stimulating .
i love him .
we 're very evolved .

a year at harvard and you 'll see this `` federal service '' is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves `` citizens '' and take airs for the rest of their lives .
it 's about a man who gets a second chance .

i 'm afraid you 're lying , mimi . you see , i really did see wynant last night .
i don 't know ...
i would like to finish reading this . what would i talk about ? i haven 't read this month 's almanac . i don 't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes . they pride themselves in making life hard and that 's not my cup of tea .
we got you on tape making the deal . we got you bragging about the quality . we got you bragging about your business . we got you .
i don 't know , tommy . i don 't know if it 's ... normal .
yes , okay , exactement !
we have to .
they tried ... but i didn 't let them .
here you go sweetheart , throw it my way .

kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy . maybe freddy can 't get to new kids without someone like me . someone to bring them to him .
don 't be too long .

twenty ? !
then and now . but not right now .
after the cold war ...
because i love her . what can i tell you ?
i don 't know . maybe it 's because i love debbie or maybe it 's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad . i 'm not sure .
faith , i think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word .
we found him like this --
mr. hardy ?
what 's the problem here ?
good for you .
no ! there 's an adult bookstore back there ! i 'll be right back !
amen .
cute , evan .
and i 'll tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors . one step closer and i 'll shove this up your ass !
it should taper off tomorrow , but it can come back again . you have cramps ? they 'll ease up , almost entirely . as long as the bleeding isn 't heavy , it 's normal .
i got ta work off some of this adrenaline . i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn . anybody want in ?
save your money , stud muffin . the lady at the end of the bar sends her love .
what ? that 's disgusting !
let 's lift up her shirt .
that 's not bad for any day .

check the core for radiation . carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries .
mighta been civilian .
lafayette will not be happy ...

whatta you got there ... some kinda pop nine , the fuckin ' fiat of guns , always jammin ' at the wrong time .
yeah , well how the hell you get something like that wrong ? that 's a damn big boat . it 's either sunk or it ain 't .
i 'm calling it my `` contraption '' - we 're going to surround it with a boma- a fence , to you- and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door .
what the hell are you talking about , greek ?
you do if you 're where i am . where you want to be . how 'd you get that punch in the stomach , roy ?
no -- please listen ! they 're coming ... coming for me and my baby .
tonight 's the night .
thanks . i 'll phone hildy right away to get that story .
run down and get some smelling salts , will you ?
thanks . i hope you can come for the launching .
not loving enough . that is a terrible thing to do to someone . i suppose i did it to clive . always held something back .
and the spare is safely sitting in jerry 's garage .
what !
i 'm sorry , mr. gardner . i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone .
what 're you talking about -- i 'm not a dope fiend ! i saw it ! i 'll show you !
what ?
y'ever heard of a double agent , bill ? i 'm beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist ... after the arrest , 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again . now here 's another one for you : what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine ?
well , they offered you the carrot , and you turned it down ... you know what 's coming next , don 't you , boss ?
i 'm on my way .
a maker 's mark , please . up .
so , then , you really think you 're going to go ahead with this ?
no sir .
no , it 's all yours . it 's on me ... for saving my ass back there .
he wasn 't going to shoot her , you murdering son of a bitch !
did they ask you a lot of questions ?
ok ... and if it 's you who gets killed ? ... then ? talking about other people 's death is easy , but what about yours ? she 's here ! she moves around you , and can get you in a thousandth of second . because it was your day , your hour , your second ...
wow . i 'm glad i met you .
hey , that 's dad 's throne ! how did adrian get that ? is dad okay ?
i was going to let you out , eventually , cassius . i swear .
it would be so okay .
all the conveniences for the condemned , if you ask me .
not for me , thanks . no , i 'm too weary .
i can 't let him go alone . it 's suicide !
right , bob .
well , if the bugs have hatched , and they 're not here ... then where are they ?
actually , you may have .
i 'm fine , lamar .
your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office ...
i don 't want john anderton hurt .
yeah ? and if she was ugly ?
siddown , thomas , siddown .
there 's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another .
you can 't help me , man .
why ya always got ta go lookin ' for a gift in the mouth of the horse ?
generally that doesn 't work out so well . it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change .
according to the ancients , cat 's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld . imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated , and then he will fear nothing .
my dear , sweet , baby sister , i 'll have you know , that at this moment my career is on a high note .
deal .
what do you mean , sir ?
i 'm trying to spare you an embarrassment . johnny roselli is on his way back here .
but change always comes slowly . i 've withdrawn more than half the troops . i 'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years . i want an all-volunteer army . but it 's also a question of american credibility , our position in the world ...
well that hardly sounds like you ...
well as the rev says , god helps those who help themselves . we 'll be our own stoplight .
n ... n ... ... not ... oh .
you fit the profile , brother . you look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust ...
i 'm not my mother . i can 't have the respect without the knowing .
harry , harry , harry ...
well , it 's always better to take precautions -- but i 'm sure church will be all right , honey ...
me neither . but i believe in knowing your enemy .
he didn 't waste it .
how did he get off the island ?
gee whiz `` bud '' , what could we possibly need when we have each other ?
why did they have to stop it ? why did they have to stop it ?
you 're not only an animal , you 're a stupid animal . you 're rotten . rotten . rotten . you 're a sick maniac . a maniac ! you belong in a mental hospital .
didn 't you take it to the crime lab ?
thank you .
nick don 't talk till nick gets something .
i won 't again .
second best .
amen to that . it 's been a crazy day , hasn 't it ? !
thank you .
you will have to make all the jokes , because i 'm going to be very serious .
then it is decided . leo and durk and i will make our plans .
how do you mean ?
you do ?
well , why don 't you hold these as evidence in the meantime .
yeah . good .
a little weak today .
i believe so .
computer . request security procedure and access to project genesis summary .
raise shields ! energize phasers , stand by to --
ah ... the giants .
data , if you were following the boy and discovered this ship ...
the `` mighty '' federation could learn a few things from this village ...
what kind of message ?
sorry . we got knocked out pretty quickly .
a real skunk .
stick up ?
i had it , a minute ago ...
impossible .
you thought my father was crazy ?
uh , hey buddy . oh boy , am i pissed . you 're not going to believe this -- well , you 'll believe it , there 's no reason not to -- but i just got beeped for emergency surgery . well , um , sorry , but i 'm going to have to bail on you .
no time , magda , my show 's starting .
okay , just calm down . it 's going to be okay .
mcnamara 's on his way back here now . we need to pick the right ship . no subs . no armed boarding parties either . we need a little more time to figure this one out .
good . thank you .
i 've had enough ... for now .
oh , leland .
no biggie , really .
we don 't have no paper bags .
the candelabras were my gran 's .
no .
sure . the keys are on the dresser next to ... to your book .
you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town , and i 'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood .
we 're here now . let 's get her done .
he couldn 't be that dumb . the guy 's a trained killer . bud 's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling one night over laundry duty .
but why , claudia ? ... why ?
who knows why they all left ...
eh , don 't take out me lines .
don 't be cheeky , i 'll bind him to me with promises . come on , grandad .
well ... if he 's your grandfather , who knows ?
i 'll see what i can do .
quit complaining ; we 're in space .
he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general --
i 'll bet you do , you little horndog , she 's givin ' you fuckin ' stiffies , right ?
the draft of that river might be too shallow on the point .
fuck you , fuck cleveland , and fuck your contracts --
and not even then sometimes .
it 's perfect , you 've done a great job .
uh -- yeah . i 'm new here , and i 'm supposed to be in this class .
figures . anybody seen my scope ?
fuck ... i forgot about that .
thank you , alfred . i hope you 'll excuse me . it was a great pleasure meeting you . and you .
the attic .
would you two excuse me for a moment ?
yeah sure , if i 'm ever in the neighborhood , need to use the john .
huh ?
c'mon dude , eventually she 'll get sick of her little game and , you know , wander back --
i haven 't forgotten .
he will .
that 's where you belong ...
why ? 'cause you know him ?
let 's go -- we got to get away from this phone .
here .
fixed ?
look out !
they 're not that dumb , after all .
i 'm sorry . that was impressive . the ... tumbling .
your turn .
we all deserve to wear white .
me ? that 's why the bosses sent me out here . they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint . like these two fuckin ' balloon-heads over here [ eddy and jerry ] . they were gon na try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin ' grand ? yeah , right , i 'm sure .
don 't look at me , pal . i got ta live with her .
men , huh ?
fine , fine , at a later date , i 'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who 's not the creep . but for now , i 'm drilling inside your brains ... i bring up the whole catwoman thing for one reason . i bit captain god in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses -- `` my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.. ''
no thanks .
these 'll be kept . i 'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly . i will also provide them -
too late for what ? too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ? well , you won 't do it , i tell you . you won 't do it !
not yet .
because he 's out of shape .
don 't say that . you 'll embarrass frank .
no harm done , ma'am .
an apology .
shut the hell up .
i don 't know if you 're the best lawyer i 've got or a high school sophomore .
hey , you 're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world . i took a shot . it didn 't work . did you bring the tapes ?
cool .
jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us .
now that 's more of what we 're looking for .
or maybe crossing a river !
i see the truth of it . -- reverend mother could he be the one ? ... maybe ... but will he be ours to control ? you know when people speak the truth ?
don 't worry , i 'll teach you .
that 's enough , tracy . quit while you 're ahead , okay ? i 'll handle this . could you ask walt to come in ?
my god --
twenty-eight years .
you can 't blame me for trying .
hey ...
this wasn 't our first stop , in case you forgot nasa . and victor 's not that bad . he 's just a little ... larger than life .
we 'll know -- in the next breath ...
on the repeater .
geez . that 's more'n i 've heard you say all week .
oh , those numbers are all right , bleemee .
what do you get out of it ?
how does a nice mature fuck sound ?
clown ? now back up there , buddy ...
i ... i ... went to this bar ... this very , ya know -- hard-to-get-in place ... called babbitt 's ...
oh please ! ... i was born a catholic in brooklyn ... i 've been to hell and back ... . i 'll be fine ... ... .thanks ... you 're a gem .
hey , you and tommy lasorda . that 's great .
it was nothing .
alright , alright .
el paso .
of course . i don 't want to scare you off . not before i 'm finished with you .
go .
you sure i can 't go with ya ?
whole-grain pancakes . and an egg- white omelette .
it 's got doors , diane . private as can be . tom ?
no , the funniest show that mickey and i ever did was the one we won the emmy for .
oh , no ! i mean , everyone thinks things like that .
you 're welcome . it 's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor 's swing set .
john , i 'm sure she could support just about anything . i think i 'll see you to your room . a sort of bodyguard . make sure no harm comes to you .
and sold it to mister laplante , the fence , who 's now trying to blackmail poor john .
an hour after ... ! deak , for heaven 's sake ! let 's give her a night in new york city . we 'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel ...
rutherford auction ... that name ...
actually we 're in italy , snickers , she said as if it made a difference .
i don 't know . i guess she must have called him john ? i 'm mak- ing tea . would you like some ?
he 's smart , dr. grant . and he knows so much about dinosaurs .
they set a trap they actually set a trap .
you 'd be surprised what people can do when they have too .
don 't start a legal argument with me , this island isn 't your property , and neither are these animals !
yes sir . i can find it by myself .
they weren 't there . get close-ups .
no . huron serve no one . the french father believes he fooled magua because he is so proud of his cleverness , he is blind . but it is the huron path that magua walks down , not the french one ... now , les francais , also , fear huron . that is good . when the huron is strong from their fear , we will make the terms of trade with les francais . and we will trade as the white man trades . take land from the abnakes ; fur from the osage , sauk & fox . and make the huron great . over other tribes . no less than the whites , as strong as the whites .
maybe you 're more one of us than you think ... sir .
where did they get those outfits from ? haven 't we got some like that , tom ?
i 'm sick of being the one , the one who always has to do everything , i don 't want to be the one always --
michelle , she -- the king has invited her to come live in the palace .
andy , they don 't think you suck . they 've just ... lost a reason to love you .
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership ?
and what is that ?
reality tv and stay by the phone . that 's what all wives-in-crime do ...
well , uh , my manager 's gon na manage all that crap , or else he gon na get a coconut up his flue .
don 't get kinky here ...
i 'll be late .
we ?
that 's a tautology lad . if you say the queen arranges something , you 've no need to say she 's done it personally . that 's understood .
i 'm just looking for our best interests . may i have the tapes , bruce ?
what do you suggest ?
you 're a sick puppy , geller .
oh sure . of course .
i don 't know .
i knew it , soon as i saw they were offering a reward .
there are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes .
shut up .
well , just keep your bloody-fuckin ' eyes open . don 't want that ratbag sneakin ' up on me bloody-fuckin ' arse .
now what , dutch . you going to send your mystery guest an invitation ?
i don 't need pills ... just sleep .
... okay ... you made your point .
really ? is that a fact ... ?
there 's not even enough places to stash it in a car .
i told you , my car broke down .
exactly . gregor , he was the russian 's man . it was my people came up with the idea for this run , but the russians who had the capital to finance it . gregor , he was their insurance , and i was ours . everybody else was supposed to be neutral . gregor must 've got to swede ...
maybe . who cares ?
no . no , you didn 't .
i don 't have much choice in the matter now , do i ? but i can 't speak for italics . traitor !
how am i going to explain this to walter ?
with ramn it 's ... pride . i spoke out of the bitterness in me . and he was hurt .
they got squirrels there , too , right ?
forward ! forward ! now reverse !
if you were diane court , would you honestly fall for lloyd ?
youre all in this together ?
understood . if you 'll excuse me detective . gale .
yeah , we just watched a few movies . took a few notes . it was fun .
not until trading places in '83 . jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies . she didn 't show her tits until she went legit .
oh , god ...
deal .
stealing the cattle was just to pull us out ... this here 's a murder raid ... it shapes up to scald out either your place ... or my brother 's .
well ... i know there were some captives recovered ...
yeah ! what is it ?
i know what you need - a slug of bourbon .
i dont do naked . my sister ? she does naked .
well what would you know about it ? you don 't have anything to lose .
so buzz , let 's skedaddle . mr. kastle is waiting . as buzz gets up , theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs .
clam it !
what are they ?
thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .
maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ...
hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
we 're not leaving you here , sir !
what ? and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders ? how many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors ?
yeah , well , mikey , listen up . cause here 's a lesson : life 's not fair .
huh ? oh jesus ...
that 's okay , hannah . it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies . sex - you can learn from movies . but robberies ? there 's no way .
i seem to be .
in other words , push this red button .
get a hold of yourself , vera . nobody else ever will .
yes .
it does , huh ? clark kent , i 'd like you to meet lois lane .
open the goddamn door !
hey , hey , slow up , fraulein straube has to take down what you say .
did you ? kudos .
he came to my mind recently , that 's all .
all your life . that happened while i swam the length of my pool .
that 's right , your life is shit , and i 'm to blame . it 's that simple .
as far as i needed .
we have free will and intelligence -- which god allegedly gave us ... .
get out of my way .
